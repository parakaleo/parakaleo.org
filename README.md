### Usage:

In development mode, run `yarn dev`. This
- starts livereload
- enables WYSIWYG editing in the console via calls to `edit()` and `save()`
- livereload also works across ngrok tunnels :)

To save work, add routinely changing information to `js/macros.js`.

### Book keeping:
For posterity, it may be a good idea to keep documents, fliers, recordings, etc.
in the `documents` directory and linked in the `resources.html` page.

### Deployment
TODO
