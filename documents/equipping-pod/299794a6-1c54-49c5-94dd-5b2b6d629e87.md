> So let's pray.
>
> Oh Lord, thank you that you are our God who loves us more than we can possibly ask or think. Lord, as we go forward in life and learn to trust you more, we see you more. And the more we do, the more staggered we are by your love and your desire and the reality of it, that you are the God who walks with us as well as in us by your life, by the Holy Spirit.
>
> And that you are using the very stuff of life, the very challenges and difficulties and even failures, as well as successes. All of it is part of your building us more into your image from the inside out, from the Holy Spirit at the core, the new creation, out into our thinking and attitudes and words and actions.
>
> And Lord, we ask that in this new year, we will each of us give you joy in the way we think and the way that we act and speak out of that. May our lives be contagious for you, for others. May they see you more and more clearly in each one of us where you have led each of us to walk, wherever in the world we are.
>
> And thank you that you are on the ground with us wherever we are. You're our Emmanuel God. And we're so thankful. We need you to be that. And we thank you for each one.
>
> Lord, please do bring relief to the pain for Beth. And thank you for your work in us and in this world. In your name, Amen.

Well, welcome. So good to see you. And we do pray that you're entering this new year just walking, thriving in the Lord as we all face many challenges, as well as wonderful joys and opportunities.

So tonight, we're going to do a number of things. We already started on a bit of it, which will continue after class. And that is a chance to share where we may have seen the Lord at work or heard him speak during the break so that we can all encourage one another. God sightings, as we like to call it, that encourages all of us.

But before that, we want to share a passage that is very familiar, that some of you may have heard us present before, but we felt led to start the new year with it. And that is 2 Corinthians 1.

The way in which our amazing God uses the very challenges of our lives and even successes and failures as part of his equipping to be able to come alongside of others with sensitivity, with his word as we go to him to learn how to deal with whatever the current challenge is. And that no matter what it is, the Lord promises to use it for equipping as well as for comfort and counsel for us.

And so we will look at this passage with many examples and may, whether you've heard it before, even taught it before, may it be an encouragement for fresh growth and vision for how the Lord wants to use it as you serve where he's planted you.

And then the latter part of our time, we will also give vision for what we'll be doing this quarter. I'll just give a brief summary of that now.

We're using this year as a time of equipping, both for personal growth, but also to equip you to be able to serve better, to speak God's word with wisdom into the lives of those around you. Because as you avail yourself of it for yourself, the Lord is faithful to bring you opportunity after opportunity as you are alert to that.

And so that's what we were doing in the fall quarter, and we're continuing it now. We're focusing this quarter especially on the issue of how actually to grow.

And again, some of you have heard us teach this a number of years ago. We've learned a lot more since then and can summarize it better because you want some succinct forms as well as how the Lord explains it through Paul's infinite detail.

And so again, our prayer, and we will be working this out in a lot of practical examples. You'll again get to be in Romans 10 and grow from it as we are, as we've taught it and been in it many times. But the Lord always speaks more deeply as we've grown and are ready to grow more.

And that it will be for equipping so that you can explain it to people, and especially where all of us get stuck, where we're praying for growth.

As we actually were doing the intro right now, I am the vision. Many, many believers, maybe even most, if they've genuinely come to the Lord, there's so much joy in the new life. And now you hope that they're confident that they will be home with the Lord when this life is over.

But what about the meantime? In the meantime, a lot of people just try to be good. They keep adding more, understanding more of God's calling, and it turns into trying to be good enough, or when they realize that doesn't work, to pray that God will change them and then feel very discouraged because the growth is very slow and lots of backtracking.

And where's God? And sometimes even pastors that we've heard will say, I'm not sure people can actually change.

And we have come to realize that many Christians, at least in this age, have not understood what's been there all the way along in scripture of how we participate with the Lord for real change, what the blocks are that keep us stuck and how to participate with the Lord in identifying and unlocking those and how to actually step forward and get to know the Lord himself as we do that.

So that's what we'll be presenting in this quarter, and we will go at the beginning of Romans, the downward spiral, and then we won't go through all of Romans, not even all of the early part. We will be focused on the how to change parts.

So then we will be working with how to identify those underlying factors that keep us stuck and how to move forward in cooperation with the Lord.

And this is equipping for each of us. Our prayer is that all of us will make real growth progress, even in familiar areas where we may have grown, but there's definitely room for more. People who live with us could tell us that or work with us. And the Holy Spirit nudges us that there's more to go.

And so... hopefully this will be a very encouraging quarter for personal growth and also then equipping so that you can explain it from the text to others.

So it's both personal growth and equipping, which is always our dual focus in all the teaching that we do. And we hope it is for you too, even in counseling. It's our dual focus so that people aren't dependent on us, but we whet their appetite to see the practical wisdom in scripture so that they will dig in more themselves and welcome the Holy Spirit speaking and working in their lives and then equipped to help others.

So, and this goes worldwide, nationwide, worldwide, and we're all so aware how much it's needed.

So that's what we'll be doing this quarter. Tonight, we're starting with 2 Corinthians 1, 1 through 11. And this is the passage that we actually felt inspired to name our ministry from. Because the key word that you will see again and again and again, it's almost a tongue twister, is the word parakaleo or some form of it from the Greek, which means to call alongside.

The Lord comes along, calls us alongside him. Then he calls us alongside others, and we get to call them alongside him. And it translates in the very rich English terms to comfort, to console, to encourage, entreat, urge, beseech, counsel. It covers a broad range and all of it is what our God loves to do and what we have the opportunity to join him to do in the lives of others.

And as you learn from this passage, you will—and welcome it for your own life—he will start bringing you people who need to hear what you've just learned. And that's what this passage says. So this is how the Lord uses our daily lives and the big challenges, the little challenges, even places of failure, as well as successes. If we're learning how to go to him with them, he will use it so that you can come alongside others and draw them alongside the Lord's good counsel and comfort.

So, 2 Corinthians starts, Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother to the church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

I'm going to comment after each paragraph, and Steve, of course, will too. And, you know, Paul, an apostle, one sent forth by Jesus, to Aunt Timothy, a brother. And then we talk about grace, peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These are not just kind of polite terms of address.

There are churches where it's common to refer to fellow believers as brother or sister. A lot of times it seems like that's just sort of the lingo of the group, but it's actually true. A genuine believer is a new creature in Christ because of having received the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the life of the living God, from God the Father, the life giver. And that does make us his children.

Every true believer, every believer who's invited Jesus in, and that he comes in via the Holy Spirit, that person then is a child of God, child of the Lord God, the true God. And so... God is truly our Father. Our life, not our physical, not our natural life that came from our earthly parents. But this is spiritual life.

And the fellowship among those who have that life, and particularly with the Father and the Son, is what eternal life is. Jesus defined eternal life in his so-called high priestly prayer, John 17, where he says in prayer to his Father and our Father, that this is eternal life, that they may know you, and this is not know about, this is know intimately, personally, deeply, you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you've sent.

So, eternal life is available here and now, and we enter into the experience of it and expression of it progressively as we grow, which is parallel to what happens on the natural level. We now have—we're in the grandparents phase. We have a five-year-old and we have not quite a year and a half old twins. And we're watching them go through these phases and they are acquiring and expressing more and more life, more and more natural human life as they grow, as they learn, and as they become more familiar with the parents and their life, again, on the natural level, hopefully on the spiritual level as well.

And so God truly is our Father. All of us who have entered into true faith in Jesus, looking to the Lord for salvation from all of the mess of the fall, which is basically what happens in life when people try to do it without God. And we do plenty of that, all of us.

And so grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. Before we move on, this greeting is actually remarkable because Corinth was Paul's pain in the backside church. They were on the far fringes of sexual debauchery in the pagan world.

That says a lot because the pagan world was pretty sexually active. But in Corinth, it didn't matter who, whether you were married or not, didn't matter what sex or not. You just needed to be sexually active as soon as you were and as soon as you could. And even the pagan world had coined a term to Corinthianize, meaning just ridiculously far out on that edge.

So here, Paul, what's remarkable and really is an encouragement to us, is that Paul is writing to all the saints who were in Corinth and throughout Achaia. So he is including believers who are fresh out of that background.

First Corinthians, he's addressing one big issue after another because nothing, godliness is not normal for them in any form. And so he had a lot to address to try to help them to learn to live godly in Christ Jesus. And so here he is addressing them as saints, as holy ones, because they have the Holy Spirit within, the life of the Lord through the Holy Spirit, and he completes what he begins.

And so Paul knows, the Lord knows, what has begun, God will finish, no matter how big the task. And that's encouraging to us. And it's encouraging when we meet with people whose instincts are just not good. You sometimes can despair of, oh my gosh, Lord, there's so much that needs to be addressed here. And there are so many forms of death because of that. Where do we even start? But the Lord starts and he completes what he begins, even with Corinthians.

And so we're all saints. We're all holy ones, no matter what, as long as there's genuine trust and the Holy Spirit is there. We've seen the Lord do remarkable things in people who've come from very rough backgrounds, but have gotten to know them and walk with them over decades and watch the Holy Spirit change them as he changes us, which is remarkable.

So, and then that wonderful greeting: grace and peace from God, our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. And as Steve said, we have a heavenly Father, and many people, because their association with their earthly father is very negative, it's just one of law and condemnation and continually trying to run your life. Even though we had one friend who was a pastor who said, "My parents are still trying to remake me as if I were in junior high." And he was in his sixties going on 70. They figured they hadn't finished the job and they needed to do more.

It's easy for people to have a not good association with the concept of father. We've helped and come alongside students where there's been sexual or physical abuse or just total being untrustworthy. I was actually just counseling Matt recently with this student on a different continent who was really struggling because of natural family, and here to be able to reassure the student that you have a heavenly Father who loves you unconditionally and you are part of the family of God, and that's where your life comes from. So it was a huge encouragement.

And then earthly parents become a place of service, of prayer, of getting to the long-term messy ministry to people who were among the last to see the Lord in you. So it's in the grace and peace, and we've talked about this before, but grace is charis. It was the Greek normal greeting. Instead of saying hi, they would say charis. They have a form of that now, except it didn't mean more than just hi. But it's grace. It means favor. We have favor from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, not condemnation, as Romans 8:1 will assure us, but favor and peace, deep well-being.

And though it's in Greek, it's grace. It's alluding to the Jewish typical greeting, Shalom, which is far more than "I'm not out to get you." It's not "I'm not about to shoot you," but it is deep well-being. And we have God's favor and deep well-being. And, you know, we all long for that. But we have it from the Father and the Son, and we get to extend that to one another.

Okay, so we get into the message:

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

So here we have five of the ten occurrences of this term in this paragraph. Father of mercies and God of all comfort. We've come to describe the concept of mercy as, and someone with the gift of mercy is someone who readily recognizes other people's needs and their ability to help meet them. And whatever our need is, whatever the challenge is, whatever the struggle is, the answer is always in the Lord, in our Heavenly Father.

And then comfort, coming alongside, calling us alongside him into close communion with him and with each other, with Father and Son and our fellow believers. And so we immediately now get into something beyond the individual experience: The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercies and God of all comfort.

All right. Who comforts us in all our affliction. That's where we first engage it. We have things that are getting us down or pressing us down that are causing us to struggle emotionally, individually and in relations with things we're trying to manage in relation to other people with whom we're trying to relate beneficially, wherever all involved. So first, he addresses our need. But he's looking beyond it. He's not just comforting us in all our affliction, but he's doing so so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

We're not the end of the interaction. God always intends things to go farther. We don't come to the Lord just to get our selfish needs and desires satisfied. But as we learn that, as we get to know our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus better, then we come into a position of being able to be firsthand witnesses of how God works in people's lives.

Generically. Initially here, he's talking about generically. We're able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. It applies to every kind of affliction. And so the first thing is we learn that just generically. And there's plenty.

Just as our sufferings are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ. I'll backtrack a bit with some examples and then we'll continue. But this is so helpful to know that as we're going through difficult times, where we don't know what to do. We're in over our heads and all of us have plenty of times like that in our lives that we, first of all, we have a heavenly father who is a father of mercies and mercy.

Part of the meaning of that is he sees needs and he moves in instead of seeing our needs, even if it's self-generated and, instead of being repulsed, because a lot of times humans, when we're going through difficult times, they back away because either they're just, they don't know how to handle it. They don't know what to say.

There are a lot of people in the hospital who get no visits because their family don't know what to say. So they just don't go where they're afraid of death. And this is a reminder that their time is coming. So they don't go.

But we have a God, no matter what we're going through, no matter whether it's self-generated or is circumstantial or from others, we have a God who sees our need and moves in to help. And he's a God of all comfort.

And as we said, this is the term parakaleo. So it could also be the God of all counsel. He's a God of all comfort and counsel. And I actually, as I go through this passage with people and receive it for myself, I read it as both. That as I'm going through things, he is there to comfort and counsel me.

And he comforts and counsels us in all our affliction, not just some of it. So not just when it had nothing to do with my choice. I just happened. Or, you know, maybe it had everything to do with a bad choice I made. And it resulted in trouble.

All of our affliction so that we may be able to comfort and counsel those in any affliction with the comfort and counsel with which we ourselves are comforted and counseled by God.

And so, that's encouraging that nothing that we go through has no purpose. It's easy at times when we're in pain, when things happen that we just didn't expect. It's like the bottom dropped out of health or work that someone had and we're doing their best, but all of a company end or the company saying, we don't want you anymore.

Had various people in recent years fired and they were doing good work. But, you know, it's easy to end up feeling like, how did I get here? How did this happen? And to know that we have a God who is there to comfort and counsel us no matter where the affliction comes from.

And an example of that, this is true confessions, when I was going through Stanford, it was not a stellar academic performance. I went, as most Stanford students do, I was kind of the cream of the crop going through a very tough, high caliber college prep, private high school, boarding school, and, you know, was one of the top five.

And, you know, I was excited about being at Stanford. And then the academics, just I was definitely not anywhere near the top five. It was not a great season academically. And part of it was I was a new believer and discovered people. And that was actually the Lord's preparation for a counseling ministry because I ended up growing a lot and counseling a lot of students when I should have been studying.

So, but it was the Lord's preparation for what he had me doing later. But at that point I was dealing with a lot of shame and it, the Lord really went to work on my self-concept, because my worth before had come from the perfectionistic. I've worked hard and I'm at the top.

And, the perfectionism is a big deal for most Stanford students and most of us, many of us. And when you're not at the top, you really get rocked with what is my worth from my performance? That's what I thought. I might not have stated it that way, but it's in fact where it came from.

And the Lord went deeply to work to grow me so that I came to know that my worth was in him, not in my performance. Yes, I wanted to do my best and work unto him. But that time of struggle, which many Stanford students go through and other students, PhD students, the long, long run, we were just hearing about and hearing that in the last week where it's a long haul and there are many failures and false starts along with some successes.

And so it really sifts and sorts who you are and where your worth comes from. And the Lord does a massive growth in the lives of believers through that.

Well, I've been able to share about my academic experience at Stanford. And it has given so much comfort and encouragement to others. And I, in fact, flunked chemistry the first time through.

I remember going for the father-daughter walk with my father out at my grandparents along the canal. And I was trembling in my boots and praying, knowing the question was going to come. So how are things going academically?

And yep, sure enough, there came the question. And I gulped and prayed and told him I flunked chemistry. And he knew with a twinkle in his eye that I couldn't see yet to let me roast a little bit. So there was silence while I'm squirming inside. And then he burst out laughing.

And he said, you know... I've—I'm a doctor, I've been in medicine for most of my career, and you know what? I flunked chemistry also and it hasn't made a hoot of difference. And you know, even that is—I went to the Lord for my worth and then my relationship with my father, and it actually brought me closer to my father. So, um, it was the Lord's sweet care in the midst of a very painful time.

But the question is, how do you hear that comfort and counsel? Because I just in the last week with various counseling situations heard, I am praying, I am seeking to connect with the Lord in this tough time, but I am not hearing him. So how do we connect with that comfort and counsel?

And it takes being in the word regularly. It's not just going to come out of blue sky. The Lord does do that occasionally in desperate situations. We knew someone who was about to commit suicide and the Lord graciously had flaming letters show up on her wall telling her to read a book that was not Christian, but the closest thing pointing her in that direction that was in the house. And she was completely isolated and began her journey to come to the Lord.

But usually the way to cultivate hearing him, hearing his comfort and his counsel is be in the word yourself regularly, every day—not as I need to have my quiet time so I can check off my duty because I'm a good Christian, but I want to be there to meet with the Lord, to hear him, to get to know him.

I pray from scripture to the Lord. It's like a window to him where I get to know him. It's like the Eastern Orthodox icons, except this is scripture where he self-describes. And we get to see how he works with real people like me and get to hear his priorities, his word.

And as we cultivate that and welcome it and grow, then when we're in the midst and it's very difficult to hear him because the Lord seems a million miles away, like a telescope flipped in the wrong direction, and the circumstances are huge and the Lord seems minute and we don't feel like we're reaching him. But if you've been in the word regularly and growing from it and connecting with the Lord through it, then as the Lord promised, the Holy Spirit will guide you into all the truth.

Well, he can't guide you into truth you haven't exposed yourself to. And so the best way to be hearing him is listening intently to his word, praying from it, seeking, growing, seeking to respond regularly. And then when you're in crisis and you don't know what's going on or even little stuff, but you're just grabbed by the, I don't know what to do.

The Lord, the Holy Spirit has a lot of truth that he can bring to your mind and he'll often bring a phrase or even just a few words. And you can cross reference to that passage and do it and ask, and then read the context so that the Lord can speak more broadly. And you will find he will counsel you from that scripture.

And if you can't find something, ask somebody who is walking closely with the Lord, knows the word, and ask where in scripture would they find counsel for what you're going through. And so you get to benefit directly by the Holy Spirit and from other people. And it's all equipping to be able to come alongside of others.

Because once you do that, the Lord will start bringing you people who need to hear exactly what you've just learned. And we've even had brand new baby believers who, as an elder, shared a need, came up afterwards and said, I know what to do about that. And it was the one verse they knew, but it was exactly what that elder needed to hear and be reminded of.

At that point, it was the Lord speaking. So we get to come alongside and be part of the Lord's work to comfort and to counsel. So in this block, the point is, it doesn't matter what the issue is. We do have resources from our own walk with the Lord, no matter how young, new, or how mature, how long we've been walking with the Lord. Whatever we have come to know of the Lord and His working is always valuable to every believer.

And it doesn't matter if you're not able even to address anything about the specifics of the concern that the person has shared. You can express what you know of the Lord, and it will apply. Everything we get to know of the Lord applies throughout life.

So that is, we're getting to know, and we are assured that there are lots of hard experiences in life. Verse 5: "Just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ." It's everywhere, and that's an encouragement to us that the Lord promises to match every bit of affliction with His comfort and counsel. We're never without a resource. And a lot of times believers don't understand that.

Yep. The afflictions, the suffering, is abundant. This is a broken world. And a lot of times believers coming to the Lord think, "Now my life is going to be great, easy, delightful, full of joy and joy." That's right, right into heaven. But Scripture is very realistic that we live in a broken world, and even within the church believers are growing but coming out of a lot that is not from the Lord, and so it shows up in the church as well.

And instead of being surprised and rocked by it and turned off by it, it's instead saying, yes, Scripture is very realistic, but the Lord promises to match every bit of it with His comfort and counsel, and that's so encouraging.

Okay, now we move to another aspect, and that is verses six and seven: "If we're afflicted, it's for your comfort and salvation; or if we're comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings we also suffer. And our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing it is your share of our sufferings, so also you are of our comfort."

And so now we move from the general application to the specific application. And this is a reason why I want to take advantage of every opportunity to grow and learn from the Lord and to see Him meet my needs. In every area that I see Him working to meet my needs, as I entrust that area to Him, I am gaining firsthand experience and testimony about how God works in that kind of a situation.

And so it's even more effective if I can respond to somebody sharing something that's really weighing on them and they're struggling with by saying, "I know at least something about what you're going through because I've been through similar." Of course, I haven't been through exactly what you're going through, but I've been through similar. I've seen God work in that kind of a situation because He's worked in that kind of a situation in my life.

And it may be that sharing about circumstances that I went through, not in the "Oh, well, you're going through that. Oh, I've been through that," and blah, blah, blah, and all the focus goes on me. It doesn't really help the person who's struggling. But knowing that somebody has firsthand experience in the same arena, even though, of course, not exactly the same in all the details, is a great encouragement. It's not just talking in generalities.

Again, it's helpful to know that each thing we go through is specific. The Lord is offering specific comfort and counsel and that it's specific equipping for other people. And that gives purpose to the suffering. It's not that suffering has value in and of itself, but that the Lord wants to use it for equipping if I'm willing. If I don't just implode into "woe is me, I hate this, I don't want to be here, why am I here?" If that's my approach or just collapsing into depression, then I won't learn very much.

But if I thank the Lord, even through my tears, and say, "Teach me, help me to grow, help me to hear Your comfort and counsel, especially from Your Word, as well as by Your Spirit, Your Spirit through Your Word, as well as directly and through others, and equip me through it to help others," I will learn a lot. And then I will have a lot of specific opportunities.

And again, an example: I know I've shared with quite a few of you over the years. I've been through a lot medically in the last few years. I've got metal in my wrist, in my elbow, torn biceps tendon and rotator cuffs and surgery from that. And then a year and a half ago, fluid on the lungs and in my heart, which can be fatal.

And, you know, I would not have chosen to sign up for any of these things or the pain that came through fixing it, let alone the injury, which was massive, especially with the shoulder. But as I, instead of just getting angry, "Lord, how could this happen?" or "I'm just imploding into it, I feel miserable," I'm just staying there. I'm instead saying, okay, thank you, Lord. I would never have chosen this or signed up for it. But I know from this passage, it's training time. And I don't want to miss you. I don't want to miss your presence and your speaking to me directly. And I don't want to miss the training to help others.

As I did that, especially with this last one with the fluid on the heart and the lungs, I was in the hospital for four days and it looked like it was going to be a lot longer and it seemed eternal. I couldn't sleep, in pain, awake in the night as well as the day. And with a roommate who was very loud about her needs and pains, and also right across from the nurse's station. They were partying all night too, I think, to stay awake and encourage each other in between all their care.

Anyway, I got to go to the Lord and just thank Him, trust Him, ask to hear Him, and also be available to serve right there. And as you know, from those who know the story, I ended up with a traveling nurse. It was her last night on my last night. She ended up seeing the Holy Spirit within me, even though I looked like a wreck, hadn't seen a brush in four days and so on. She recognized the life of the Lord.

She ended up sharing how weary she was. I said, well, I know what to do with weary. "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I quoted all of the "Take my yoke, the yoke upon you and learn from me," word for word, disciple. "And you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my yoke is gentle and light." I'm paraphrasing, which you should never do.

But anyway, she just started to weep. I was asked if I could pray for her, which I got to do at midnight. Then she said, "I wish we could hug each other." I said, "Well, why not?" So I jumped out of bed, tubes and all, gave her a big bear hug and said, "You know, this hug is from God." She said, "I know," tears running down both of our cheeks.

I got to equip her from scripture. She was headed home to a different state and going to be looking for a church. I gave her scripture to read. So, you know, if that was the immediate purpose, if that was it for all of that, it was worth it.

But also, the equipping the Lord gave me then was equipping that I could have come alongside many with. I used to serve as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital, and I've had many chances since to come alongside former students who are post-surgical with lots of pain and complications or who are dying and getting to bring the Lord's specific comfort and counsel.

So He's always equipping us if we're thanking Him and eager to receive, eager to grow. Then He will bring us opportunity after opportunity where He is wanting to work and we get to be the ones, as part of His body, to express Him in specifics from the scriptures that He's spoken to us.

There are just countless opportunities, and you come out dancing, getting to be part of the living God coming alongside people in need. Every one of us is surrounded by people in need if we're alert to the Holy Spirit and alert to those who are hungry and would like to know more.

So this is real. And it's promised if we go for it with thanksgiving and trust and listening and walking in what He shows us.

It is helpful to know the sufferings are abundant, and in the sufferings of Christ, some of that's just raw persecution. I'm seeking to be of help to a refugee in desperate straits in Turkey. But it also happens here. Then getting to encourage others who are going through it as well.

Because our comfort is abundant, not just the suffering. And counsel is abundant.

Then the next thing that Paul does is he shares with these people about how the Lord has been working specifically in his life. Verses 8 and 9:

"We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of our affliction which came in Asia, that is Asia Minor, that we were burdened excessively beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, we have the sense of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead."

It really helps if people who are trying to encourage in the Lord hear something about other people's experiences—not just piling all of our stuff on top of the stuff they're already struggling under, but in being real, not just being the academic or scholarly or professional caregiver with what in secular counseling is referred to as clinical detachment—the importance of not getting too engaged personally.

But it helps people to know about how the Lord is working in other people's lives and what kind of seemingly dire straits we've been in and how the Lord worked.

But yes, yes, we're overwhelmed. That's normal. But God is never overwhelmed. And He is with us always. Jesus promised that to the disciples. And Paul references it in various of his letters, such as Philippians 4, verse 4, I think. And it's helpful for people to hear testimony of that.

And yes, I was beyond my limits, but I was not beyond the Lord's limits. I was not beyond the limits of my Heavenly Father, not beyond the limits of my Lord Jesus. But the pressure I was under was to pressure me into turning to the Lord and trusting this and trusting the situation to him who is able to do what I can't and is eager to do what I can't, and his way which may or may not be what I envision.

I may make suggestions to him in prayer of how I think he would do well to address this situation because I think that would be good for me. And there are times when he says, no, no, I've got better than that. That may be good, but that's not good enough. Let me show you how I'm able to work way beyond what you would imagine from what you've experienced to date.

The end of chapter three of Ephesians, Paul is wrapping up the discourse on God's equipping for interpersonal relationships and then moving into, okay, now how do we—how do we live and work our way through the challenges of interpersonal relationships? He prays to the one who is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think according to the power that works within us.

And I like to quote from a pastor who was very influential in my equipping, especially for counseling. And I remember hearing Bob, Bob Rowe, in a memorial service say, and of course, in a memorial service, there are lots of unbelievers who are there, mostly out of a sense of social obligation. They'd rather be elsewhere, but they better show up for whoever is now gone and pay my respects.

And so he asked, so he said, people ask me what heaven is like. Oh, he had a lot of attention all of a sudden. I'll tell you. I don't know. So it's not that I don't know a lot about what heaven is like, but I know it's beyond that. In fact, this text says it's exceedingly beyond that. Not only that, it's exceedingly abundantly beyond that. And that includes everything I could ask or think.

So what is heaven like? Way, way beyond our wildest expectations about what is actually good and what is truly light.

And so we have this sentence of death in the form of, I don't have what it takes to handle this within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. That no matter how bad it is, and dead is about as bad as it gets, no matter how bad it is, he can raise himself out of it. And he does.

And then Paul goes on. Why that? Just again, a couple of examples. Sometimes the Lord brings up things before a ministry opportunity that you don't have.

And decades ago now, we were working with a team in Hungary and they got in contact and said they had someone on the team who was deeply depressed. He was actually bipolar and kind of jumping between extremes, but unrealistic in all of it.

And we said, we're planning to come as you requested and do some more teaching among you this summer. And they said, that's not soon enough. We need you now. Could you please come help if this is causing real mayhem among the whole staff and making our ministry very difficult?

And so we prayed and a Christian businessman said, I'll fund your going. And so Steve was getting set to leave to come alongside this man and the team. And Steve got deeply depressed before going. And it wasn't that it came out of nowhere. It felt like it.

But, you know, the Lord will use things that where we still get to grow. I can't remember what it was, but whatever it was, Steve got very depressed and we were praying and he didn't come out of it until just a day or two before getting on the plane. And he was still kind of barely out.

And on the plane to go and ended up meeting with the team that first evening and shared openly what he had just been going through. They asked, how are you doing? So I told them. And I told them that I'd been deeply depressed just before the time of coming over. And what the Lord did, how he reached into me and how he brought me out of the miry depths.

And that was the Lord's preparation to be able to talk with this staff, because it told him that Steve understood and that he wouldn't be condemning what's wrong with you, why aren't you cheerful in Jesus? But instead, here in Christian ministry, you should be cheerful, you should be on top of things, you should have everything together. You shouldn't be down in the dumps. That's a bad example for people.

But instead, Steve's open, vulnerable sharing and sharing how the Lord had resolved it opened the door for ministry to this man and the team. And it happens as you pray for missionaries. This sort of thing is a regular occurrence. You're going to be on the front lines and you get hit hard.

And we had a counseling pastor who was phenomenal. He actually was one of the team that married us. It took a team.

When Erica appeared, I was halfway out of the blocks before I realized I can't run up and give her a big hug. I have to wait until she gets there. I don't know, but I imagine that as they saw me start to lunge, the two pastors who were co-officiating probably both took a dive for me, but the Lord checked me before they did. This is not that situation. No, it was one of those two pastors.

He was on his way out to teach in a conference in the Far East. The church had given him and his wife a week's vacation in Hawaii before he would leave. Well, he got decked with deep depression during that week. It was no vacation.

When they arrived in Hawaii, the team arrived to pick him up and continue on. He said, "You guys have to go. I can't go. I can't go with you. I'm just so totally wiped out." And then Tim said, "Oh, all right." And they went to work and they prayed and they shared and he came out of it and was very, very effective ministry.

So as you pray for those who are on the front lines, including us, which we so appreciate, people on the front lines get hit hard with extra spiritual warfare, but God, but the Lord uses it for equipping. And that's what Paul is sharing here.

Here, the great apostle gets hit with despair. It was actually over the Corinthians. It was over a misunderstanding. But he didn't share the why here. It was just, he was hit hard and was despairing of life because, and you find out from the letter, it was a difficult misunderstanding with the church and that he despaired even of life.

And he says he wasn't even able to minister when there was an open door for ministry. He was so just imploded in the despair. Have had his ministry been in vain. And the Lord used that in order—

Why does he let us go through things like this? In order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead.

And I remember learning this from the Lord right after giving birth to our second. I had torn as in getting the baby out and was in a lot of pain for weeks and weeks afterwards while I'm nursing a newborn and caring for our six-year-old and doing ministry and so on. And I remember just being in despair of, "Lord, am I ever going to get well?" Just that feeling it's never going to end.

And the Lord took me to these verses and said, "Let me show you why. It's in order that you should not trust in yourself, but in God who raises the dead." And that was so encouraging. It was, "Oh, thank you, Lord. That's the answer." And it actually picked me up so much that I felt like I healed from that point on pretty quickly.

So it was just, that's when he pointedly taught me this message and then has continued to over the years.

And what we see in the rest of this letter is there was a very difficult situation going on in the church at Corinth and Paul had written a letter and it was intended to bring about healing and reconciliation. And instead, they took it as condemnation. When the congregation took it as a signal that they were just climb all over this guy and work him over, which is not what Paul intended at all. And they thought Paul was upset with them.

And in fact, so as he says, I didn't, there was an open door for ministry. I couldn't go through it. I had to connect with those who were coming from Corinth because I had to know the reality of what was happening. But before that, he trusted in God who raises the dead.

Yeah, yeah. Who always leads us in his triumph. And he heals and strengthens us, usually apart from the situation while we're still in the midst before then dealing with the situation that was causing the difficulty. Because the key is that we learn to trust in him for life and not another thing or people.

And so he says in verse 10, "Who delivered us from so great a death and will deliver us, in whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us." So he's done it in the past. He's doing it now with the current issues. He will keep doing it in the future, no matter what issues come up.

And then verse 11, "You also joining in helping us through your prayers. The thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through many." This is really key: prayer support.

Now, it's very important that whatever prayer support—prayer support for those seeking to minister to others, prayer support for those they're seeking to minister to—that the sharing of the prayer request and prayer concerns needs to be in the context of absolute preservation of privacy and anonymity. Churches are ripped apart by things that people share with others under the label of "so-and-so needs prayer." You wouldn't believe what so and so has been doing, and so forth. No, it's very, very important. And this again, we emphasize this, we try to mention it periodically: do not ever share anything with anyone about something that person of concern has not either declared publicly—so the person himself or herself has made it public information—or you have explicit permission from that person. Not just a general kind of okay, but explicit permission that it is okay for you to tell this person or these people or anybody about this.

And if so, stick within the limits of what they have told you; it's okay to share. God knows the details. God does not need to know from you or from somebody you're talking with, sharing the concern with, because you do genuinely care for the person of concern. God doesn't know. God doesn't even need to have you say who it is you're praying about.

And you may be praying for somebody. You don't know who it is. But you may be praying for somebody with thus and such an issue going on. And you don't need to know who it is. When you pray, you can just reference, "Lord, I want to pray for the person that Joe Blow mentioned, who's struggling with whatever is specific," but nothing beyond that.

And it's really important. People assume that, "Oh, the person I'm talking to and the person I'm talking about will never connect with each other." Don't kid yourself. You would be amazed at some of the accounts that we have heard of something that someone shared with someone about someone else getting around to the person it was about or to someone who will know from the details included who it is and shouldn't know about it.

You don't ever want to be in the position where two people meet. We literally have known of two people who one would never expect would meet each other, meeting each other halfway around the globe under bizarre circumstances. But this is not something we've heard once; we've heard a number of instances. It's really amazing.

But what we take as a guideline is: I don't ever want to be talking to anybody about anyone and have that person be able to say, "Well, you haven't said who it is, but you mentioned enough specifics that I'm sure I know who it is," or "I think I know who it is." You never want to be in that position.

Let people tell their own story. Keep quiet about what's private to people. And, you know, she said, go into your closet, close the door, and talk to the Lord about it. That's how it's going to be effective.

It's very easy for people—and this is part of where you get gossip stuff going in the church—to spend much more time asking people to pray for so-and-so about this terrible thing that's going on than they spend actually praying. And the question always is: if you spent the time that you spend asking somebody else to pray about this, if you spent that time praying, how much more prayer would get done than as a result of your asking other people to pray about it?

So just a few more comments on this part. It's helpful to have that confidence that no matter what is going on, God loves to raise from the dead and to deliver us from so great a peril of death and will deliver us. He on whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us. We have a God who loves to come to the rescue and who loves to work even in horrendous circumstances.

And as he has been saying earlier in the passage, it's for equipping to help others as well as direct ministry from him to us. An example of this is we have a friend who has done a lot of work in missions in some very dark places in Africa. She was equipped to help women recover who had survived attempted genocide, where they had seen their family spread gruesomely all over the walls of their house.

And how do you go on? How do you remake a life? How do you rebuild after something that extreme? And the confidence here—I mentioned an example of that—there's a situation we didn't know any of the individuals involved where exactly that's what happened. The husband was murdered and then the murderers put pieces of his body all over the house.

What a thing to come home to. And no surprise, she just went into a total catatonic state. She just... I think she was there. What? I think she was there. But anyway, go ahead. Doesn't matter. Go ahead. No. Go ahead. Sorry.

She came in to find that. And she just... She was unable to communicate. She was just as rigid, stiff as a board. They carried her to the church and gathered a group around that just prayed and read scripture, especially read scripture. They just read scripture hour after hour. Around the clock, somebody was constantly reading scripture to this woman.

And it took a long time, but she came out of it. And it's possible we were thinking of two similar incidents. And, uh, it's the word of God and it's got himself and it's turning to him that there, and, and by the way, death takes many, many forms. There's not just physical death.

A lot of times when scripture talks about death, it's not talking about physical death. It's talking about the death of separation from God, of having to try to make it through life without the God who designed us and who created this life for us to walk through it with him. And that's what makes all the difference.

It doesn't matter what the situation is. God is the life giver. He not only gives life, but also then uses it to equip, to help others.

So, this example of a friend of ours who has worked with genocide survivors: she had a group of women who had survived, to help them rebuild a life after just a shattering experience and season. Within the group, there were two witch doctors, and one of them got mad at somebody else in the group and started throwing curses on her.

One of the other witch doctors said, "Wait a minute, we have covenanted in this group to be for each other, and you're throwing curses on her?" She ended up, the one who was questioning this, ended up coming to the Lord.

Well, part of the healing of people who have survived genocide, as with other extreme situations and less than that, as this passage is saying, is to be equipped and then help others. It's part of their own healing to help others who have been through a similar situation and to come alongside with the understanding and with the hope and the encouragement in the Lord. And that's part of their healing as well as getting to help others.

And it's true here. Women have been sex trafficked. It's true of not only extremes, but even the things of our daily lives as we've been talking about. And the confidence that just as you share in our suffering, so also you share in our comfort and counsel, that the Lord meets us and guarantees to do that as we're willing to receive what he wants to say and wants to do and go with him rather than just get angry that we're in that situation or just implode because we're there.

Instead, to place our hope in the one who raises from the dead and who loves to deliver, he on whom we've set our hope, and you also joining and helping through your prayers, that thanks may be given by many on our behalf for the favor bestowed upon us through the prayers of many.

As we're going through things and we ask for prayer from others, then all of us are in the front row seat to see God at work. And that's the beauty of it. Instead of saying, "Oh, I don't want to bother people," or "I feel like I can't ask for prayer," and it may be too personal, it may be something that you want to ask just one or two close friends who will encourage you, count on to keep it confidential, and to pray.

That is the Lord answering through the prayers of many or few. But when it's something that I can share, the people that I share with who pray are in the front row seat with me to see what God will do. And so we're all encouraged.

No matter what we're going through, it's not just for us. It is, as I said, at least generically equipping to be of generic health, real health. Generic doesn't mean it's not real. It's just on the level of the things that are common to all the kinds of struggles that we go through. And then there's specific equipping for specific things.

Years ago, early days of the ministry, we would often pray as something came up, "Lord, who's this for?" And we had a sense of the need to dig into the word and get the answers on this because we had the sense there's probably somebody who really needs this, that we're going to come into contact with, the Lord's going to bring into contact with us very soon. And we need to be prepared.

It's amazing how often that actually happened very clearly, where the connection with what the Lord has walked us through was very clear. So this is a jam of a passage. We encourage each of us to keep going to it for hope, for comfort, for counsel, and equipping to help others.

Just as Paul here gives the testimony and personal report and so forth, so what is it? It's about what's happening between him and that church. So what comes out of it is Paul explains how his ministry works. And that's 2 Corinthians 2:14 to 7:3.

It's fascinating. If you read through 2:13 and jump to 7:4, you don't see any gap. There's no sense anything was left out. So grand excursus, which is the whole point, what the Lord has taught Paul. He said, "You know, I had no peace because I didn't find Titus and I didn't get the report."

And then at 7:4, having been talking all about the principles of ministry and how to minister to others, he suddenly says, "But then with the coming of Titus and the report that everything's fine between you and us." It's amazing. Sometimes I sit down and read it and just make that jump. But the beautiful thing about it is it's a demonstration in this letter of how God uses election—that we go through and are turning to Him and walking through it with Him—to bless many others. Countless people have been greatly blessed through this letter and that explanation from 2:14 to 7:3, which is a description of ministry in general, the dynamics of how ministry works, and specifically of the counseling ministry.

So anyway, enjoy reading it and letting the Lord give you more equipping out of this text.

So again, for any who were not here at the beginning, for the rest of this quarter, we will be looking at Romans and other passages about how to actually change. And if it's a review for you, we understand it much better now, and hopefully it will result in real growth and equipping to help others.

But this is the material, especially for moments. So we'll be in the text as well as other texts and also to understand what are the underlying issues that need to be addressed, no matter what the specific growth issue is, to set us free to actually grow.

And our goal is twofold: one, for all of our growth and encouragement, and then also for equipping so that you can explain from these passages to many others that the Lord will bring you alongside.

So we're looking forward to the quarter together. So let's pray.

And then for those who want to stick in, we'd love to share in God's sightings—however the Lord spoke to you, showed Himself to you during the break—or, of course, a question about the passage we were just in, or an example of it.

So, and again, prayer request for me: I will be having spinal surgery on January 26th, and the pre-op is tomorrow. So we'd love your prayers that it will be completely successful, Lord willing, and that the recovery will go smoothly. I will keep joining in and Zoom in as much as I possibly can. Otherwise, Steve and Alan will be teaming it together. So, and the Lord above all.

Good, well, let's pray.

And then for those who want to share in God sightings or prayer requests, then we get to do that.

Lord, thank You that You do speak and You do act in the midst of the real stresses and challenges of life in a broken world, whether it comes from our own choices or the choices of others, or just what's going on nationally, internationally, the environment, whatever the cause. Thank You that You are right here to comfort and to counsel us and use that as specific equipping to come alongside many others in our lives where You draw us along, call us alongside, so we can share with them what has given us hope and new life and moving forward with more life than we had before.

Thank You for each one of our brothers and sisters. Use this passage for equipping, for encouragement, for growth, and for walking with You who are above as we deal with the many, many challenges in this life. In Your name, amen.


Let's pray.

It is so good to see your names and to be together again after this break. We hope that your Christmas was one full of joy and worship, and that in the new year you are walking forward with joy in the Lord's presence, because He loves you.

Oh Lord, thank You that You are our God who loves us more than we can possibly ask or think. Lord, as we go forward in life and learn to trust You more, we see You more. The more we do, the more staggered we are by Your love and Your desire and the reality of it, that You are the God who walks with us as well as in us by Your life, by the Holy Spirit.

You are using the very stuff of life, the challenges and difficulties and even failures, as well as successes. All of it is part of Your building us more into Your image from the inside out, from the Holy Spirit at the core, the new creation, out into our thinking and attitudes and words and actions. And Lord, we ask that in this new year, we will each of us give You joy in the way we think and the way that we act and speak out of that. May our lives be contagious for You, for others. May they see You more and more clearly in each one of us where You have led each of us to walk, wherever in the world we are.

Thank You that You are on the ground with us wherever we are. You're our Emmanuel God. We need You to be that. We thank You for each one.

Lord, please do bring relief to the pain for Beth. Thank You for Your work in us and in this world. In Your name, Amen.

Welcome. We pray that you're entering this new year walking, thriving in the Lord as we all face many challenges, as well as wonderful joys and opportunities.

Tonight, we're going to do a number of things. We already started on a bit of it, which will continue after class. That is a chance to share where we may have seen the Lord at work or heard Him speak during the break so that we can all encourage one another. God sightings, as we like to call it, encourage all of us.

Before that, we want to share a passage that is very familiar, that some of you may have heard us present before, but we felt led to start the new year with it. That is 2 Corinthians 1.

The way in which our amazing God uses the very challenges of our lives and even successes and failures as part of His equipping to be able to come alongside others with sensitivity, with His word as we go to Him to learn how to deal with whatever the current challenge is. No matter what it is, the Lord promises to use it for equipping as well as for comfort and counsel for us.

We will look at this passage with many examples and may, whether you've heard it before, even taught it before, it be an encouragement for fresh growth and vision for how the Lord wants to use it as you serve where He's planted you.

In the latter part of our time, we will also give vision for what we'll be doing this quarter. I'll just give a brief summary of that now.

We're using this year as a time of equipping, both for personal growth, but also to equip you to be able to serve better, to speak God's word with wisdom into the lives of those around you. As you avail yourself of it for yourself, the Lord is faithful to bring you opportunity after opportunity as you are alert to that.

That's what we were doing in the fall quarter, and we're continuing it now. We're focusing this quarter especially on the issue of how actually to grow.

Some of you have heard us teach this a number of years ago. We've learned a lot more since then and can summarize it better because you want some succinct forms as well as how the Lord explains it through Paul's infinite detail. Our prayer is that as we work through practical examples, you will grow in understanding Romans 10. The Lord always speaks more deeply as we grow and are ready to grow more.

This will be for equipping so that you can explain it to people, especially where all of us get stuck and are praying for growth.

Many believers, maybe even most who have genuinely come to the Lord, experience much joy in the new life and hope to be home with the Lord when this life is over. But what about the meantime? In the meantime, many try to be good. They keep adding more, understanding more of God's calling, and it turns into trying to be good enough. When they realize that doesn’t work, they pray that God will change them and then feel discouraged because growth is very slow with lots of backtracking.

Where is God? Sometimes even pastors say, "I'm not sure people can actually change."

We have come to realize that many Christians, at least in this age, have not understood what has been there all along in Scripture—how we participate with the Lord for real change, what the blocks are that keep us stuck, how to participate with the Lord in identifying and unlocking those blocks, and how to actually step forward and get to know the Lord Himself as we do that.

That is what we will be presenting this quarter. We will begin with the downward spiral at the beginning of Romans. We will not go through all of Romans, not even all of the early part. We will focus on the how-to-change parts.

We will work on identifying the underlying factors that keep us stuck and how to move forward in cooperation with the Lord.

This is equipping for each of us. Our prayer is that all of us will make real growth progress, even in familiar areas where we may have grown but there is definitely room for more. People who live with us or work with us could tell us that, and the Holy Spirit nudges us that there is more to go.

Hopefully, this will be a very encouraging quarter for personal growth and equipping so that you can explain it from the text to others.

It is both personal growth and equipping, which is always our dual focus in all the teaching that we do. We hope it is for you too, even in counseling. It is our dual focus so that people are not dependent on us but are whetted to see the practical wisdom in Scripture, so they will dig in more themselves, welcome the Holy Spirit speaking and working in their lives, and be equipped to help others.

This goes nationwide and worldwide, and we are all aware how much it is needed. That is what we'll be doing this quarter. Tonight, we're starting with 2 Corinthians 1, 1 through 11. This is the passage that inspired the name of our ministry. The key word you will see again and again is the word parakaleo or some form of it from the Greek, which means to call alongside.

The Lord comes along, calls us alongside Him. Then He calls us alongside others, and we get to call them alongside Him. It translates in the very rich English terms to comfort, to console, to encourage, entreat, urge, beseech, counsel. It covers a broad range and all of it is what our God loves to do and what we have the opportunity to join Him to do in the lives of others.

As you learn from this passage, you will—and welcome it for your own life—He will start bringing you people who need to hear what you've just learned. This passage shows how the Lord uses our daily lives and the big challenges, the little challenges, even places of failure, as well as successes. If we're learning how to go to Him with them, He will use it so that you can come alongside others and draw them alongside the Lord's good counsel and comfort.

2 Corinthians starts, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother to the church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

Paul, an apostle, one sent forth by Jesus, and Timothy, a brother. Then we talk about grace, peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These are not just polite terms of address.

There are churches where it's common to refer to fellow believers as brother or sister. Often it seems like that's just the lingo of the group, but it is actually true. A genuine believer is a new creature in Christ because of having received the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the life of the living God, from God the Father, the life giver. That does make us His children.

Every true believer, every believer who has invited Jesus in, and that He comes in via the Holy Spirit, that person then is a child of God, child of the Lord God, the true God. God is truly our Father. Our life, not our physical, not our natural life that came from our earthly parents, but this is spiritual life.

The fellowship among those who have that life, and particularly with the Father and the Son, is what eternal life is. Jesus defined eternal life in His so-called high priestly prayer, John 17, where He says in prayer to His Father and our Father, "that this is eternal life, that they may know you," and this is not know about, this is know intimately, personally, deeply, "you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you've sent." Eternal life is available here and now, and we enter into the experience of it and expression of it progressively as we grow, which is parallel to what happens on the natural level. We are in the grandparents phase. We have a five-year-old and not quite a year and a half old twins. We watch them go through these phases as they acquire and express more and more natural human life as they grow, learn, and become more familiar with the parents and their life, hopefully on the spiritual level as well.

God truly is our Father. All of us who have entered into true faith in Jesus, looking to the Lord for salvation from all the mess of the fall, which is basically what happens in life when people try to do it without God. We do plenty of that, all of us.

"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ." Before we move on, this greeting is remarkable because Corinth was Paul's pain in the backside church. They were on the far fringes of sexual debauchery in the pagan world.

That says a lot because the pagan world was pretty sexually active. But in Corinth, it didn't matter who, whether you were married or not, or what sex you were. You just needed to be sexually active as soon as you were and as soon as you could. Even the pagan world had coined a term to Corinthianize, meaning just ridiculously far out on that edge.

Paul is writing to all the saints who were in Corinth and throughout Achaia. He is including believers who are fresh out of that background.

In First Corinthians, he addresses one big issue after another because godliness was not normal for them in any form. He had a lot to address to help them learn to live godly in Christ Jesus. He addresses them as saints, as holy ones, because they have the Holy Spirit within, the life of the Lord through the Holy Spirit, and he completes what he begins.

Paul knows, the Lord knows, what has begun, God will finish, no matter how big the task. That is encouraging to us. When we meet with people whose instincts are not good, we sometimes despair, thinking, "Oh my gosh, Lord, there's so much that needs to be addressed here." There are so many forms of death because of that. Where do we even start? But the Lord starts and He completes what He begins, even with Corinthians.

We are all saints, all holy ones, no matter what, as long as there is genuine trust and the Holy Spirit is there. We have seen the Lord do remarkable things in people who have come from very rough backgrounds, walking with them over decades and watching the Holy Spirit change them as He changes us, which is remarkable. That wonderful greeting: grace and peace from God, our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. As Steve said, we have a heavenly Father, and many people, because their association with their earthly father is very negative, experience only law and condemnation and continual control. One friend who was a pastor said, "My parents are still trying to remake me as if I were in junior high." He was in his sixties going on seventy. They figured they hadn't finished the job and needed to do more.

It's easy for people to have a poor association with the concept of father. We have come alongside students where there has been sexual or physical abuse or just total untrustworthiness. I was counseling Matt recently with a student on a different continent who was really struggling because of natural family. It was encouraging to reassure the student that "you have a heavenly Father who loves you unconditionally and you are part of the family of God, and that's where your life comes from." It was a huge encouragement.

Earthly parents become a place of service, of prayer, of engaging in the long-term messy ministry to people who were among the last to see the Lord in you. In the grace and peace greeting, grace is charis. It was the Greek normal greeting. Instead of saying hi, they would say charis. It means favor. We have favor from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, not condemnation, as Romans 8:1 assures us, but favor and peace, deep well-being.

Though it is in Greek, grace alludes to the Jewish typical greeting, Shalom, which is far more than "I'm not out to get you." It is deep well-being. We have God's favor and deep well-being. We all long for that, but we have it from the Father and the Son, and we get to extend that to one another.

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

Here we have five of the ten occurrences of this term in this paragraph: Father of mercies and God of all comfort. We have come to describe the concept of mercy as, and someone with the gift of mercy is someone who readily recognizes other people's needs and their ability to help meet them. Whatever our need is, whatever the challenge is, whatever the struggle is, the answer is always in the Lord, in our Heavenly Father. And then comfort, coming alongside, calling us alongside Him into close communion with Him and with each other, with Father and Son and our fellow believers. And so we immediately now get into something beyond the individual experience: The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercies and God of all comfort.

Who comforts us in all our affliction. That's where we first engage it. We have things that are getting us down or pressing us down that are causing us to struggle emotionally, individually and in relations with things we're trying to manage in relation to other people with whom we're trying to relate beneficially, wherever all involved. First, He addresses our need. But He's looking beyond it. He's not just comforting us in all our affliction, but He's doing so so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

We're not the end of the interaction. God always intends things to go farther. We don't come to the Lord just to get our selfish needs and desires satisfied. As we learn that, as we get to know our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus better, then we come into a position of being able to be firsthand witnesses of how God works in people's lives.

Generically. Initially here, He's talking about generically. We're able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. It applies to every kind of affliction. And so the first thing is we learn that just generically. And there's plenty.

"Just as our sufferings are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ." I'll backtrack a bit with some examples and then we'll continue. This is so helpful to know that as we're going through difficult times, where we don't know what to do. We're in over our heads and all of us have plenty of times like that in our lives that we, first of all, we have a Heavenly Father who is a Father of mercies and mercy.

Part of the meaning of that is He sees needs and He moves in instead of seeing our needs, even if it's self-generated and, instead of being repulsed, because a lot of times humans, when we're going through difficult times, they back away because either they're just, they don't know how to handle it. They don't know what to say.

There are a lot of people in the hospital who get no visits because their family don't know what to say. So they just don't go where they're afraid of death. And this is a reminder that their time is coming. So they don't go.

But we have a God, no matter what we're going through, no matter whether it's self-generated or is circumstantial or from others, we have a God who sees our need and moves in to help. And He's a God of all comfort. And as we said, this is the term parakaleo. So it could also be the God of all counsel. He's a God of all comfort and counsel. I actually, as I go through this passage with people and receive it for myself, read it as both. As I'm going through things, He is there to comfort and counsel me.

He comforts and counsels us in all our affliction, not just some of it. Not just when it had nothing to do with my choice, when it just happened. Or maybe it had everything to do with a bad choice I made, and it resulted in trouble.

All of our affliction so that we may be able to comfort and counsel those in any affliction with the comfort and counsel with which we ourselves are comforted and counseled by God.

That's encouraging that nothing we go through has no purpose. At times when we're in pain, when things happen that we just didn't expect, like the bottom dropping out of health or work, when someone had been doing their best but the company says, "We don't want you anymore."

I've had various people in recent years fired who were doing good work. It's easy to end up feeling like, "How did I get here? How did this happen?" To know that we have a God who is there to comfort and counsel us no matter where the affliction comes from.

An example of that: this is true confessions. When I was going through Stanford, it was not a stellar academic performance. I went, as most Stanford students do, as kind of the cream of the crop going through a very tough, high-caliber college prep private boarding school, and was one of the top five.

I was excited about being at Stanford. Then the academics—just I was definitely not anywhere near the top five. It was not a great season academically. Part of it was I was a new believer and discovered people. That was actually the Lord's preparation for a counseling ministry because I ended up growing a lot and counseling a lot of students when I should have been studying.

It was the Lord's preparation for what He had me doing later. But at that point I was dealing with a lot of shame, and the Lord really went to work on my self-concept, because my worth before had come from the perfectionistic, "I've worked hard and I'm at the top."

Perfectionism is a big deal for most Stanford students and many of us. When you're not at the top, you really get rocked with, "What is my worth from my performance?" That's what I thought. I might not have stated it that way, but it's in fact where it came from. And the Lord went deeply to work to grow me so that I came to know that my worth was in Him, not in my performance. Yes, I wanted to do my best and work unto Him. That time of struggle, which many Stanford students go through and other students, PhD students, the long, long run, we were just hearing about and hearing that in the last week where it's a long haul and there are many failures and false starts along with some successes.

It really sifts and sorts who you are and where your worth comes from. The Lord does a massive growth in the lives of believers through that.

I have been able to share about my academic experience at Stanford. It has given so much comfort and encouragement to others. I, in fact, flunked chemistry the first time through.

I remember going for the father-daughter walk with my father out at my grandparents along the canal. I was trembling in my boots and praying, knowing the question was going to come: "So how are things going academically?"

Sure enough, there came the question. I gulped and prayed and told him I flunked chemistry. He knew with a twinkle in his eye that I couldn't see yet to let me roast a little bit. There was silence while I was squirming inside. Then he burst out laughing.

He said, "You know... I've—I'm a doctor, I've been in medicine for most of my career, and you know what? I flunked chemistry also and it hasn't made a hoot of difference." Even that is—I went to the Lord for my worth and then my relationship with my father, and it actually brought me closer to my father. It was the Lord's sweet care in the midst of a very painful time.

But the question is, how do you hear that comfort and counsel? I just in the last week with various counseling situations heard, "I am praying, I am seeking to connect with the Lord in this tough time, but I am not hearing Him." How do we connect with that comfort and counsel?

It takes being in the Word regularly. It's not just going to come out of blue sky. The Lord does do that occasionally in desperate situations. We knew someone who was about to commit suicide and the Lord graciously had flaming letters show up on her wall telling her to read a book that was not Christian, but the closest thing pointing her in that direction that was in the house. She was completely isolated and began her journey to come to the Lord.

Usually the way to cultivate hearing Him, hearing His comfort and His counsel is to be in the Word yourself regularly, every day—not as "I need to have my quiet time so I can check off my duty because I'm a good Christian," but "I want to be there to meet with the Lord, to hear Him, to get to know Him." I pray from Scripture to the Lord. It’s like a window to Him where I get to know Him. It’s like the Eastern Orthodox icons, except this is Scripture where He self-describes. We get to see how He works with real people like me and get to hear His priorities, His word.

As we cultivate that and welcome it and grow, then when we’re in the midst and it’s very difficult to hear Him because the Lord seems a million miles away, like a telescope flipped in the wrong direction, and the circumstances are huge and the Lord seems minute and we don’t feel like we’re reaching Him. But if you’ve been in the word regularly and growing from it and connecting with the Lord through it, then as the Lord promised, the Holy Spirit will guide you into all the truth.

He can’t guide you into truth you haven’t exposed yourself to. The best way to be hearing Him is listening intently to His word, praying from it, seeking, growing, seeking to respond regularly. When you’re in crisis and you don’t know what’s going on or even little stuff, but you’re just grabbed by the, I don’t know what to do.

The Lord, the Holy Spirit has a lot of truth that He can bring to your mind and He’ll often bring a phrase or even just a few words. You can cross reference to that passage and do it and ask, and then read the context so that the Lord can speak more broadly. You will find He will counsel you from that Scripture.

If you can’t find something, ask somebody who is walking closely with the Lord, knows the word, and ask where in Scripture they would find counsel for what you’re going through. You get to benefit directly by the Holy Spirit and from other people. It’s all equipping to be able to come alongside of others.

Once you do that, the Lord will start bringing you people who need to hear exactly what you’ve just learned. We’ve even had brand new baby believers who, as an elder, shared a need, came up afterwards and said, I know what to do about that. It was the one verse they knew, but it was exactly what that elder needed to hear and be reminded of.

At that point, it was the Lord speaking. We get to come alongside and be part of the Lord’s work to comfort and to counsel. In this block, the point is, it doesn’t matter what the issue is. We do have resources from our own walk with the Lord, no matter how young, new, or how mature, how long we’ve been walking with the Lord. Whatever we have come to know of the Lord and His working is always valuable to every believer.

It doesn’t matter if you’re not able even to address anything about the specifics of the concern that the person has shared. You can express what you know of the Lord, and it will apply. Everything we get to know of the Lord applies throughout life. We are assured that there are lots of hard experiences in life. Verse 5: "Just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ." It is everywhere, and that is an encouragement to us that the Lord promises to match every bit of affliction with His comfort and counsel. We are never without a resource. Many believers do not understand that.

The afflictions, the suffering, are abundant. This is a broken world. Many believers coming to the Lord think, "Now my life is going to be great, easy, delightful, full of joy and joy." Scripture is very realistic that we live in a broken world, and even within the church believers are growing but coming out of a lot that is not from the Lord, and so it shows up in the church as well.

Instead of being surprised and rocked by it and turned off by it, Scripture is very realistic, but the Lord promises to match every bit of it with His comfort and counsel, and that is encouraging.

Now we move to another aspect, verses six and seven: "If we're afflicted, it's for your comfort and salvation; or if we're comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings we also suffer. And our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing it is your share of our sufferings, so also you are of our comfort."

We move from the general application to the specific application. This is a reason to take advantage of every opportunity to grow and learn from the Lord and to see Him meet my needs. In every area that I see Him working to meet my needs, as I entrust that area to Him, I gain firsthand experience and testimony about how God works in that kind of a situation.

It is even more effective if I can respond to somebody sharing something weighing on them and struggling with by saying, "I know at least something about what you're going through because I've been through similar." Of course, I have not been through exactly what you are going through, but I have been through similar. I have seen God work in that kind of a situation because He has worked in that kind of a situation in my life.

Sharing about circumstances I went through is not in the "Oh, well, you're going through that. Oh, I've been through that," and all the focus goes on me. That does not really help the person who is struggling. But knowing that somebody has firsthand experience in the same arena, even though not exactly the same in all the details, is a great encouragement. It is not just talking in generalities. Again, it's helpful to know that each thing we go through is specific. The Lord is offering specific comfort and counsel and specific equipping for other people. That gives purpose to the suffering. It's not that suffering has value in and of itself, but that the Lord wants to use it for equipping if I’m willing. If I don’t just implode into "woe is me, I hate this, I don’t want to be here, why am I here?" or collapse into depression, then I won’t learn very much.

If I thank the Lord, even through my tears, and say, "Teach me, help me to grow, help me to hear Your comfort and counsel, especially from Your Word, as well as by Your Spirit, Your Spirit through Your Word, as well as directly and through others, and equip me through it to help others," I will learn a lot. Then I will have a lot of specific opportunities.

An example: I have been through a lot medically in the last few years. I’ve got metal in my wrist, in my elbow, torn biceps tendon and rotator cuffs and surgery from that. Then a year and a half ago, fluid on the lungs and in my heart, which can be fatal.

I would not have chosen to sign up for any of these things or the pain that came through fixing it, let alone the injury, which was massive, especially with the shoulder. Instead of getting angry, "Lord, how could this happen?" or "I’m just imploding into it, I feel miserable," and staying there, I said, "Thank you, Lord. I would never have chosen this or signed up for it. But I know from this passage, it’s training time. And I don’t want to miss You. I don’t want to miss Your presence and Your speaking to me directly. And I don’t want to miss the training to help others."

As I did that, especially with this last one with the fluid on the heart and the lungs, I was in the hospital for four days and it looked like it was going to be a lot longer. It seemed eternal. I couldn’t sleep, in pain, awake in the night as well as the day. I had a roommate who was very loud about her needs and pains, and also right across from the nurse’s station. They were partying all night too, I think, to stay awake and encourage each other in between all their care.

I went to the Lord and thanked Him, trusted Him, asked to hear Him, and also was available to serve right there. As those who know the story can attest, I ended up with a traveling nurse. It was her last night on my last night. She ended up seeing the Holy Spirit within me, even though I looked like a wreck, hadn’t seen a brush in four days, and so on. She recognized the life of the Lord. She ended up sharing how weary she was. I said, "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I quoted all of the "Take my yoke, the yoke upon you and learn from me," word for word, disciple. "And you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my yoke is gentle and light." I'm paraphrasing, which you should never do.

She just started to weep. I was asked if I could pray for her, which I got to do at midnight. Then she said, "I wish we could hug each other." I said, "Why not?" So I jumped out of bed, tubes and all, gave her a big bear hug and said, "You know, this hug is from God." She said, "I know," tears running down both of our cheeks.

I got to equip her from Scripture. She was headed home to a different state and going to be looking for a church. I gave her Scripture to read. If that was the immediate purpose, it was worth it.

The equipping the Lord gave me then was equipping that I could have come alongside many with. I used to serve as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital, and I've had many chances since to come alongside former students who are post-surgical with lots of pain and complications or who are dying and getting to bring the Lord's specific comfort and counsel.

He is always equipping us if we are thanking Him and eager to receive, eager to grow. Then He will bring us opportunity after opportunity where He is wanting to work and we get to be the ones, as part of His body, to express Him in specifics from the Scriptures that He has spoken to us.

There are countless opportunities, and you come out dancing, getting to be part of the living God coming alongside people in need. Every one of us is surrounded by people in need if we are alert to the Holy Spirit and alert to those who are hungry and would like to know more.

This is real. It is promised if we go for it with thanksgiving and trust and listening and walking in what He shows us.

It is helpful to know the sufferings are abundant, and in the sufferings of Christ, some of that is just raw persecution. I am seeking to be of help to a refugee in desperate straits in Turkey. But it also happens here. Then getting to encourage others who are going through it as well.

Our comfort is abundant, not just the suffering. And counsel is abundant.

Then the next thing that Paul does is he shares with these people about how the Lord has been working specifically in his life. Verses 8 and 9:

"We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of our affliction which came in Asia, that is Asia Minor, that we were burdened excessively beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, we have the sense of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead." It really helps if people who are trying to encourage in the Lord hear something about other people's experiences—not just piling all of our stuff on top of the stuff they're already struggling under, but in being real, not just being the academic or scholarly or professional caregiver with what in secular counseling is referred to as clinical detachment—the importance of not getting too engaged personally.

It helps people to know about how the Lord is working in other people's lives and what kind of seemingly dire straits we've been in and how the Lord worked.

Yes, we are overwhelmed. That's normal. But God is never overwhelmed. He is with us always. Jesus promised that to the disciples. Paul references it in various of his letters, such as Philippians 4, verse 4. It is helpful for people to hear testimony of that.

I was beyond my limits, but I was not beyond the Lord's limits. I was not beyond the limits of my Heavenly Father, not beyond the limits of my Lord Jesus. The pressure I was under was to pressure me into turning to the Lord and trusting this and trusting the situation to Him who is able to do what I can't and is eager to do what I can't, and His way which may or may not be what I envision.

I may make suggestions to Him in prayer of how I think He would do well to address this situation because I think that would be good for me. There are times when He says, no, no, I've got better than that. That may be good, but that's not good enough. Let Me show you how I'm able to work way beyond what you would imagine from what you've experienced to date.

At the end of chapter three of Ephesians, Paul is wrapping up the discourse on God's equipping for interpersonal relationships and then moving into, okay, now how do we—how do we live and work our way through the challenges of interpersonal relationships? He prays to the One who is able to do "exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think according to the power that works within us."

I like to quote from a pastor who was very influential in my equipping, especially for counseling. I remember hearing Bob Rowe in a memorial service say, and of course, in a memorial service, there are lots of unbelievers who are there, mostly out of a sense of social obligation. They'd rather be elsewhere, but they better show up for whoever is now gone and pay respects.

He said, "People ask me what heaven is like." He had a lot of attention all of a sudden. "I'll tell you. I don't know." It's not that he didn't know a lot about what heaven is like, but he knew it's beyond that. In fact, this text says it's "exceedingly beyond that. Not only that, it's exceedingly abundantly beyond that." That includes everything we could ask or think.

So what is heaven like? Way, way beyond our wildest expectations about what is actually good and what is truly light. And so we have this sentence of death in the form of, I don't have what it takes to handle this within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. That no matter how bad it is, and dead is about as bad as it gets, no matter how bad it is, He can raise Himself out of it. And He does.

And then Paul goes on. Just a couple of examples. Sometimes the Lord brings up things before a ministry opportunity that you don't have.

Decades ago, we were working with a team in Hungary and they got in contact and said they had someone on the team who was deeply depressed. He was actually bipolar and kind of jumping between extremes, but unrealistic in all of it.

We said, we're planning to come as you requested and do some more teaching among you this summer. They said, that's not soon enough. We need you now. Could you please come help if this is causing real mayhem among the whole staff and making our ministry very difficult?

We prayed and a Christian businessman said, I'll fund your going. Steve was getting set to leave to come alongside this man and the team. Steve got deeply depressed before going. It wasn't that it came out of nowhere. It felt like it.

The Lord will use things where we still get to grow. I can't remember what it was, but whatever it was, Steve got very depressed and we were praying. He didn't come out of it until just a day or two before getting on the plane. He was still kind of barely out.

On the plane to go, he ended up meeting with the team that first evening and shared openly what he had just been going through. They asked, how are you doing? So he told them. He told them that he'd been deeply depressed just before the time of coming over. And what the Lord did, how He reached into him and how He brought him out of the miry depths.

That was the Lord's preparation to be able to talk with this staff, because it told them that Steve understood and that he wouldn't be condemning what's wrong with you, why aren't you cheerful in Jesus? But instead, here in Christian ministry, you should be cheerful, you should be on top of things, you should have everything together. You shouldn't be down in the dumps. That's a bad example for people.

Instead, Steve's open, vulnerable sharing and sharing how the Lord had resolved it opened the door for ministry to this man and the team. It happens as you pray for missionaries. This sort of thing is a regular occurrence. You're going to be on the front lines and you get hit hard.

We had a counseling pastor who was phenomenal. He actually was one of the team that married us. It took a team. When Erica appeared, I was halfway out of the blocks before I realized I can't run up and give her a big hug. I have to wait until she gets there. I imagine that as they saw me start to lunge, the two pastors who were co-officiating probably both took a dive for me, but the Lord checked me before they did. This is not that situation. No, it was one of those two pastors.

He was on his way out to teach in a conference in the Far East. The church had given him and his wife a week's vacation in Hawaii before he would leave. He got decked with deep depression during that week. It was no vacation.

When they arrived in Hawaii, the team arrived to pick him up and continue on. He said, "You guys have to go. I can't go. I can't go with you. I'm just so totally wiped out." Then Tim said, "Oh, all right." They went to work and they prayed and they shared and he came out of it and was very, very effective ministry.

As you pray for those who are on the front lines, including us, which we so appreciate, people on the front lines get hit hard with extra spiritual warfare, but the Lord uses it for equipping. That's what Paul is sharing here.

The great apostle gets hit with despair. It was actually over the Corinthians. It was over a misunderstanding. He didn't share the why here. He was hit hard and was despairing of life because, and you find out from the letter, it was a difficult misunderstanding with the church and that he despaired even of life.

He says he wasn't even able to minister when there was an open door for ministry. He was so just imploded in the despair. Had his ministry been in vain? The Lord used that in order—

Why does He let us go through things like this? "In order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead."

I remember learning this from the Lord right after giving birth to our second. I had torn as in getting the baby out and was in a lot of pain for weeks and weeks afterwards while nursing a newborn and caring for our six-year-old and doing ministry. I was in despair of, "Lord, am I ever going to get well?" Just that feeling it's never going to end.

The Lord took me to these verses and said, "Let me show you why. It's in order that you should not trust in yourself, but in God who raises the dead." That was so encouraging. It was, "Oh, thank you, Lord. That's the answer." It actually picked me up so much that I felt like I healed from that point on pretty quickly.

That was when He pointedly taught me this message and has continued to over the years. And what we see in the rest of this letter is there was a very difficult situation going on in the church at Corinth and Paul had written a letter intended to bring about healing and reconciliation. Instead, they took it as condemnation. The congregation took it as a signal that they were to climb all over this guy and work him over, which is not what Paul intended at all. They thought Paul was upset with them.

As he says, there was an open door for ministry, but he couldn't go through it. He had to connect with those who were coming from Corinth because he had to know the reality of what was happening. Before that, he trusted in God who raises the dead, who always leads us in His triumph, and who heals and strengthens us, usually apart from the situation while we are still in the midst, before then dealing with the situation that was causing the difficulty. The key is that we learn to trust in Him for life and not another thing or people.

He says in verse 10, "Who delivered us from so great a death and will deliver us, in whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us." He has done it in the past, is doing it now with the current issues, and will keep doing it in the future, no matter what issues come up.

In verse 11, "You also joining in helping us through your prayers. The thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through many." This is really key: prayer support.

It is very important that whatever prayer support—prayer support for those seeking to minister to others, prayer support for those they are seeking to minister to—that the sharing of the prayer request and prayer concerns needs to be in the context of absolute preservation of privacy and anonymity. Churches are ripped apart by things that people share with others under the label of "so-and-so needs prayer." You wouldn't believe what so-and-so has been doing, and so forth. It is very important. We emphasize this periodically: do not ever share anything with anyone about something that the person of concern has not either declared publicly—so the person himself or herself has made it public information—or you have explicit permission from that person. Not just a general kind of okay, but explicit permission that it is okay for you to tell this person or these people or anybody about this.

If so, stick within the limits of what they have told you; it is okay to share. God knows the details. God does not need to know from you or from somebody you are talking with, sharing the concern with, because you genuinely care for the person of concern. God does not need to have you say who it is you are praying about. And you may be praying for somebody. You don't know who it is. But you may be praying for somebody with thus and such an issue going on. You don't need to know who it is. When you pray, you can just reference, "Lord, I want to pray for the person that Joe Blow mentioned, who's struggling with whatever is specific," but nothing beyond that.

People assume that, "Oh, the person I'm talking to and the person I'm talking about will never connect with each other." Don't kid yourself. You would be amazed at some of the accounts that we have heard of something that someone shared with someone about someone else getting around to the person it was about or to someone who will know from the details included who it is and shouldn't know about it.

You don't ever want to be in the position where two people meet. We literally have known of two people who one would never expect would meet each other, meeting each other halfway around the globe under bizarre circumstances. This is not something we've heard once; we've heard a number of instances. It's really amazing.

What we take as a guideline is: I don't ever want to be talking to anybody about anyone and have that person be able to say, "Well, you haven't said who it is, but you mentioned enough specifics that I'm sure I know who it is," or "I think I know who it is." You never want to be in that position.

Let people tell their own story. Keep quiet about what's private to people. She said, go into your closet, close the door, and talk to the Lord about it. That's how it's going to be effective.

It's very easy for people—and this is part of where you get gossip stuff going in the church—to spend much more time asking people to pray for so-and-so about this terrible thing that's going on than they spend actually praying. The question always is: if you spent the time that you spend asking somebody else to pray about this, if you spent that time praying, how much more prayer would get done than as a result of your asking other people to pray about it?

It's helpful to have that confidence that no matter what is going on, God loves to raise from the dead and to deliver us from so great a peril of death and will deliver us. He on whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us. We have a God who loves to come to the rescue and who loves to work even in horrendous circumstances.

As he has been saying earlier in the passage, it's for equipping to help others as well as direct ministry from Him to us. An example of this is we have a friend who has done a lot of work in missions in some very dark places in Africa. She was equipped to help women recover who had survived attempted genocide, where they had seen their family spread gruesomely all over the walls of their house. And how do you go on? How do you remake a life? How do you rebuild after something that extreme? The confidence here—I mentioned an example of that—there's a situation we didn't know any of the individuals involved where exactly that's what happened. The husband was murdered and then the murderers put pieces of his body all over the house.

She came in to find that. She was unable to communicate. She was just as rigid, stiff as a board. They carried her to the church and gathered a group around that just prayed and read Scripture, especially read Scripture. They just read Scripture hour after hour. Around the clock, somebody was constantly reading Scripture to this woman.

It took a long time, but she came out of it. It's the word of God and it's got Himself and it's turning to Him that there, and, by the way, death takes many, many forms. There's not just physical death.

A lot of times when Scripture talks about death, it's not talking about physical death. It's talking about the death of separation from God, of having to try to make it through life without the God who designed us and who created this life for us to walk through it with Him. And that's what makes all the difference.

It doesn't matter what the situation is. God is the life giver. He not only gives life, but also then uses it to equip, to help others.

This example of a friend of ours who has worked with genocide survivors: she had a group of women who had survived, to help them rebuild a life after just a shattering experience and season. Within the group, there were two witch doctors, and one of them got mad at somebody else in the group and started throwing curses on her.

One of the other witch doctors said, "Wait a minute, we have covenanted in this group to be for each other, and you're throwing curses on her?" She ended up, the one who was questioning this, ended up coming to the Lord.

Part of the healing of people who have survived genocide, as with other extreme situations and less than that, as this passage is saying, is to be equipped and then help others. It's part of their own healing to help others who have been through a similar situation and to come alongside with the understanding and with the hope and the encouragement in the Lord. And that's part of their healing as well as getting to help others. And it's true here. Women have been sex trafficked. It's true not only of extremes, but even the things of our daily lives as we've been talking about. The confidence that just as you share in our suffering, so also you share in our comfort and counsel, that the Lord meets us and guarantees to do that as we're willing to receive what He wants to say and wants to do and go with Him rather than just get angry that we're in that situation or just implode because we're there.

Instead, place our hope in the One who raises from the dead and who loves to deliver, He on whom we've set our hope, and you also joining and helping through your prayers, that thanks may be given by many on our behalf for the favor bestowed upon us through the prayers of many.

As we're going through things and we ask for prayer from others, all of us are in the front row seat to see God at work. Instead of saying, "Oh, I don't want to bother people," or "I feel like I can't ask for prayer," it may be something that you want to ask just one or two close friends who will encourage you, count on to keep it confidential, and to pray.

That is the Lord answering through the prayers of many or few. When it's something that I can share, the people that I share with who pray are in the front row seat with me to see what God will do. So we're all encouraged.

No matter what we're going through, it's not just for us. It is, at least generically, equipping to be of generic health, real health. Generic doesn't mean it's not real. It's just on the level of the things that are common to all the kinds of struggles that we go through. Then there's specific equipping for specific things.

Years ago, early days of the ministry, we would often pray as something came up, "Lord, who's this for?" We had a sense of the need to dig into the Word and get the answers on this because we had the sense there's probably somebody who really needs this, that we're going to come into contact with, the Lord's going to bring into contact with us very soon. We need to be prepared.

It's amazing how often that actually happened very clearly, where the connection with what the Lord has walked us through was very clear. So this is a jam of a passage. We encourage each of us to keep going to it for hope, for comfort, for counsel, and equipping to help others.

Just as Paul here gives the testimony and personal report and so forth, so what is it? It's about what's happening between him and that church. What comes out of it is Paul explains how his ministry works. That's 2 Corinthians 2:14 to 7:3.

It's fascinating. If you read through 2:13 and jump to 7:4, you don't see any gap. There's no sense anything was left out. So grand excursus, which is the whole point, what the Lord has taught Paul. He said, "You know, I had no peace because I didn't find Titus and I didn't get the report." And then at 7:4, having been talking all about the principles of ministry and how to minister to others, he suddenly says, "But then with the coming of Titus and the report that everything's fine between you and us." It's amazing. Sometimes I sit down and read it and just make that jump. The beautiful thing about it is it's a demonstration in this letter of how God uses election—that we go through and are turning to Him and walking through it with Him—to bless many others. Countless people have been greatly blessed through this letter and that explanation from 2:14 to 7:3, which is a description of ministry in general, the dynamics of how ministry works, and specifically of the counseling ministry.

Enjoy reading it and letting the Lord give you more equipping out of this text.

For any who were not here at the beginning, for the rest of this quarter, we will be looking at Romans and other passages about how to actually change. If it's a review for you, we understand it much better now, and hopefully it will result in real growth and equipping to help others.

This is the material, especially for moments. We will be in the text as well as other texts and also to understand what are the underlying issues that need to be addressed, no matter what the specific growth issue is, to set us free to actually grow.

Our goal is twofold: one, for all of our growth and encouragement, and then also for equipping so that you can explain from these passages to many others that the Lord will bring you alongside.

We are looking forward to the quarter together.

For those who want to stick in, we'd love to share in God's sightings—however the Lord spoke to you, showed Himself to you during the break—or, of course, a question about the passage we were just in, or an example of it.

A prayer request for me: I will be having spinal surgery on January 26th, and the pre-op is tomorrow. We'd love your prayers that it will be completely successful, Lord willing, and that the recovery will go smoothly. I will keep joining in and Zoom in as much as I possibly can. Otherwise, Steve and Alan will be teaming it together. The Lord above all.

Lord, thank You that You do speak and You do act in the midst of the real stresses and challenges of life in a broken world, whether it comes from our own choices or the choices of others, or just what's going on nationally, internationally, the environment, whatever the cause. Thank You that You are right here to comfort and to counsel us and use that as specific equipping to come alongside many others in our lives where You draw us along, call us alongside, so we can share with them what has given us hope and new life and moving forward with more life than we had before. Thank You for each one of our brothers and sisters. Use this passage for equipping, for encouragement, for growth, and for walking with You who are above as we deal with the many, many challenges in this life. In Your name, amen.


Oh Lord, thank You that You are our God who loves us more than we can possibly ask or think. Lord, as we go forward in life and learn to trust You more, we see You more. The more we do, the more staggered we are by Your love and Your desire and the reality of it, that You are the God who walks with us as well as in us by Your life, by the Holy Spirit.

And that you are using the very stuff of life, the very challenges and difficulties and even failures, as well as successes. All of it is part of Your building us more into Your image from the inside out, from the Holy Spirit at the core, the new creation, out into our thinking and attitudes and words and actions. And Lord, we ask that in this new year, we will each of us give You joy in the way we think and the way that we act and speak out of that. May our lives be contagious for You, for others. May they see You more and more clearly in each one of us where You have led each of us to walk, wherever in the world we are.

Thank You that You are on the ground with us wherever we are. You're our Emmanuel God. And we're so thankful. We need You to be that. We thank You for each one.

Lord, please do bring relief to the pain for Beth. Thank You for Your work in us and in this world. In Your name, Amen.

Welcome. We pray that you're entering this new year walking, thriving in the Lord as we all face many challenges, as well as wonderful joys and opportunities.

Tonight, we're going to do a number of things. We already started on a bit of it, which will continue after class. That is a chance to share where we may have seen the Lord at work or heard Him speak during the break so that we can all encourage one another. God sightings, as we like to call it, that encourages all of us.

Before that, we want to share a passage that is very familiar, that some of you may have heard us present before, but we felt led to start the new year with it. That is 2 Corinthians 1.

The way in which our amazing God uses the very challenges of our lives and even successes and failures as part of His equipping to be able to come alongside others with sensitivity, with His word as we go to Him to learn how to deal with whatever the current challenge is. And that no matter what it is, the Lord promises to use it for equipping as well as for comfort and counsel for us.

We will look at this passage with many examples and whether you've heard it before or even taught it before, may it be an encouragement for fresh growth and vision for how the Lord wants to use it as you serve where He's planted you.

In the latter part of our time, we will also give vision for what we'll be doing this quarter. I'll just give a brief summary of that now.

We're using this year as a time of equipping, both for personal growth, but also to equip you to be able to serve better, to speak God's word with wisdom into the lives of those around you. As you avail yourself of it for yourself, the Lord is faithful to bring you opportunity after opportunity as you are alert to that.

That's what we were doing in the fall quarter, and we're continuing it now. We're focusing this quarter especially on the issue of how actually to grow.

Some of you have heard us teach this a number of years ago. We've learned a lot more since then and can summarize it better because you want some succinct forms as well as how the Lord explains it through Paul's infinite detail. And we will be working this out in a lot of practical examples. Our prayer, as you'll again get to be in Romans, is that you will grow from it as we are, as we've taught it and been in it many times. The Lord always speaks more deeply as we've grown and are ready to grow more.

And we pray that it will be for equipping so that you can explain it to people, especially where all of us get stuck and are praying for growth.

Many believers, maybe even most, if they've genuinely come to the Lord, experience so much joy in the new life. And now you hope that they're confident that they will be home with the Lord when this life is over. But what about the meantime? In the meantime, a lot of people just try to be good. They keep understanding more of God's calling, and it turns into trying to be good enough. When they realize that doesn’t work, to pray that God will change them and then feel discouraged because growth is very slow with lots of backtracking.

And then asking, where's God? Sometimes even pastors say, "I'm not sure people can actually change."

We have come to realize that many Christians, at least in this age, have not understood what has been there all along in Scripture—how we participate with the Lord for real change, what the blocks are that keep us stuck, how to participate with the Lord in identifying and unlocking those blocks, and how to actually step forward and get to know the Lord Himself as we do that.

That is what we will be presenting this quarter. We will begin with the downward spiral at the beginning of Romans. We will not go through all of Romans, not even all of the early part. We will be focused on the how-to-change parts.

So then we will be working with how to identify those underlying factors that keep us stuck and how to move forward in cooperation with the Lord.

This is equipping for each of us. Our prayer is that all of us will make real growth progress, even in familiar areas where we may have grown but there is definitely room for more. People who live with us or work with us could tell us that, and the Holy Spirit nudges us that there is more to go.

Hopefully, this will be a very encouraging quarter for personal growth and equipping so that you can explain it from the text to others.

It is both personal growth and equipping, which is always our dual focus in all the teaching that we do. We hope it is for you too, even in counseling. It is our dual focus so that people are not dependent on us, but we whet their appetite to see the practical wisdom in Scripture, so that they will dig in more themselves, welcome the Holy Spirit speaking and working in their lives, and be equipped to help others.

This goes nationwide and worldwide, and we are all so aware how much it's needed. That is what we'll be doing this quarter. Tonight, we're starting with 2 Corinthians 1:1-11. This is the passage that inspired the name of our ministry. The key word you will see again and again, it's almost a tongue twister, is the word parakaleo or some form of it from the Greek, which means to call alongside.

The Lord comes along, calls us alongside Him. Then He calls us alongside others, and we get to call them alongside Him. It translates in the very rich English terms to comfort, to console, to encourage, entreat, urge, beseech, counsel. It covers a broad range and all of it is what our God loves to do and what we have the opportunity to join Him to do in the lives of others.

As you learn from this passage, you will—and welcome it for your own life—He will start bringing you people who need to hear what you've just learned. This passage shows how the Lord uses our daily lives and the big challenges, the little challenges, even places of failure, as well as successes. If we're learning how to go to Him with them, He will use it so that you can come alongside others and draw them alongside the Lord's good counsel and comfort.

2 Corinthians starts, "Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy, a brother to the church of God, which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are throughout Achaia. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

Paul, an apostle, one sent forth by Jesus, and Timothy, a brother. Then we talk about grace, peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These are not just polite terms of address.

There are churches where it's common to refer to fellow believers as brother or sister. A lot of times it seems like that's just the lingo of the group, but it's actually true. A genuine believer is a new creature in Christ because of having received the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of the life of the living God, from God the Father, the life giver. That does make us His children.

Every true believer, every believer who has invited Jesus in, and that He comes in via the Holy Spirit, that person then is a child of God, child of the Lord God, the true God. God is truly our Father. Our life, not our physical, not our natural life that came from our earthly parents, but this is spiritual life.

The fellowship among those who have that life, and particularly with the Father and the Son, is what eternal life is. Jesus defined eternal life in His so-called high priestly prayer, John 17, where He says in prayer to His Father and our Father, "that this is eternal life, that they may know you," and this is not know about, this is know intimately, personally, deeply, "you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you've sent." Eternal life is available here and now, and we enter into the experience of it and expression of it progressively as we grow, which is parallel to what happens on the natural level. We're now in the grandparents phase. We have a five-year-old and we have not quite a year and a half old twins. And we're watching them go through these phases and they are acquiring and expressing more and more life, more and more natural human life as they grow, as they learn, and as they become more familiar with the parents and their life, on the natural level and hopefully on the spiritual level as well.

God truly is our Father. All of us who have entered into true faith in Jesus, looking to the Lord for salvation from all the mess of the fall, which is basically what happens in life when people try to do it without God. We do plenty of that, all of us.

**"Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."** Before we move on, this greeting is remarkable because Corinth was Paul's pain in the backside church. They were on the far fringes of sexual debauchery in the pagan world.

That says a lot because the pagan world was pretty sexually active. But in Corinth, it didn't matter who, whether you were married or not, or what sex you were. You just needed to be sexually active as soon as you were and as soon as you could. Even the pagan world had coined a term to Corinthianize, meaning just ridiculously far out on that edge.

What's remarkable and really is an encouragement to us, is that Paul is writing to all the saints who were in Corinth and throughout Achaia. He is including believers who are fresh out of that background.

In First Corinthians, he's addressing one big issue after another because godliness was not normal for them in any form. He had a lot to address to try to help them learn to live godly in Christ Jesus. And so here he is addressing them as saints, as holy ones, because they have the Holy Spirit within, the life of the Lord through the Holy Spirit, and he completes what he begins.

Paul knows, the Lord knows, what has begun, God will finish, no matter how big the task. And that's encouraging to us. And it's encouraging when we meet with people whose instincts are just not good. You sometimes can despair, thinking, "Oh my gosh, Lord, there's so much that needs to be addressed here." There are so many forms of death because of that. Where do we even start? But the Lord starts and He completes what He begins, even with Corinthians.

We are all saints, all holy ones, no matter what, as long as there is genuine trust and the Holy Spirit is there. We have seen the Lord do remarkable things in people who have come from very rough backgrounds, walking with them over decades and watching the Holy Spirit change them as He changes us, which is remarkable.

Now that wonderful greeting: grace and peace from God, our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. As Steve said, we have a heavenly Father, and many people, because their association with their earthly father is very negative, it's just one of law and condemnation and continually trying to run your life. One friend who was a pastor said, "My parents are still trying to remake me as if I were in junior high." He was in his sixties going on seventy. They figured they hadn't finished the job and needed to do more.

It's easy for people to have a poor association with the concept of father. We've helped and come alongside students where there has been sexual or physical abuse or just total untrustworthiness. I was counseling recently with a student on a different continent who was really struggling because of natural family. And to reassure the student that "you have a heavenly Father who loves you unconditionally and you are part of the family of God, and that's where your life comes from." It was a huge encouragement.

And then earthly parents become a place of service, of prayer, of getting to the long-term messy ministry to people who were among the last to see the Lord in you. In the grace and peace greeting, grace is charis. It was the Greek normal greeting. Instead of saying hi, they would say charis. It means favor. We have favor from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, not condemnation, as Romans 8:1 assures us, but favor and peace, deep well-being.

Though it's in Greek, peace alludes to the Jewish typical greeting, Shalom, which is far more than "I'm not out to get you." It's not "I'm not about to shoot you," but it is deep well-being. We have God's favor and deep well-being. We all long for that, but we have it from the Father and the Son, and we get to extend that to one another.

**Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our afflictions so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.**

Here we have five of the ten occurrences of this term in this paragraph: Father of mercies and God of all comfort. We have come to describe the concept of mercy as, and someone with the gift of mercy is someone who readily recognizes other people's needs and their ability to help meet them. Whatever our need is, whatever the challenge is, whatever the struggle is, the answer is always in the Lord, in our Heavenly Father. And then comfort, coming alongside, calling us alongside Him into close communion with Him and with each other, with Father and Son and our fellow believers. And so we immediately now get into something beyond the individual experience: The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, Father of mercies and God of all comfort.

**Who comforts us in all our affliction.** That's where we first engage it. We have things that are getting us down or pressing us down that are causing us to struggle emotionally, individually and in relations with things we're trying to manage in relation to other people with whom we're trying to relate beneficially, wherever all involved. First, He addresses our need. But He's looking beyond it. He's not just comforting us in all our affliction, but He's doing so so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

We're not the end of the interaction. God always intends things to go farther. We don't come to the Lord just to get our selfish needs and desires satisfied. As we learn that, as we get to know our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus better, then we come into a position of being able to be firsthand witnesses of how God works in people's lives.

Generically. Initially here, He's talking about generically. We're able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. It applies to every kind of affliction. And so the first thing is we learn that just generically. And there's plenty.

**"Just as our sufferings are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ."** I'll backtrack a bit with some examples and then we'll continue. This is so helpful to know that as we're going through difficult times, where we don't know what to do. We're in over our heads and all of us have plenty of times like that in our lives that we, first of all, we have a Heavenly Father who is a Father of mercies and mercy.

Part of the meaning of that is He sees needs and He moves in instead of seeing our needs, even if it's self-generated and, instead of being repulsed, because a lot of times humans, when we're going through difficult times, they back away because either they're just, they don't know how to handle it. They don't know what to say.

There are a lot of people in the hospital who get no visits because their family don't know what to say. So they just don't go where they're afraid of death. And this is a reminder that their time is coming. So they don't go.

But we have a God, no matter what we're going through, no matter whether it's self-generated or is circumstantial or from others, we have a God who sees our need and moves in to help. And He's a God of all comfort. And as we said, this is the term parakaleo. So it could also be the God of all counsel. He's a God of all comfort and counsel. As I go through this passage with people and receive it for myself, I read it as both. That as I'm going through things, He is there to comfort and counsel me.

He comforts and counsels us in all our affliction, not just some of it. Not just when it had nothing to do with my choice, when "it just happened". Or maybe it had everything to do with a bad choice I made, and it resulted in trouble.

All of our affliction so that we may be able to comfort and counsel those in any affliction with the comfort and counsel with which we ourselves are comforted and counseled by God.

That's encouraging that nothing that we go through has no purpose. It's easy at times when we're in pain, when things happen that we just didn't expect, like the bottom dropping out of health or work, when someone had been doing their best but the company says, "We don't want you anymore."

I've had various people in recent years fired who were doing good work. It's easy to end up feeling like, "How did I get here? How did this happen?" To know that we have a God who is there to comfort and counsel us no matter where the affliction comes from.

An example of that: this is true confessions. When I was going through Stanford, it was not a stellar academic performance. I went, as most Stanford students do, as kind of the cream of the crop going through a very tough, high-caliber college prep private boarding school, and was one of the top five.

I was excited about being at Stanford. Then the academics—I was definitely not anywhere near the top five. It was not a great season academically. Part of it was I was a new believer and discovered people. That was actually the Lord's preparation for a counseling ministry because I ended up growing a lot and counseling a lot of students when I should have been studying.

It was the Lord's preparation for what He had me doing later. But at that point I was dealing with a lot of shame, and the Lord really went to work on my self-concept, because my worth before had come from the perfectionistic, "I've worked hard and I'm at the top."

Perfectionism is a big deal for most Stanford students (and many of us). When you're not at the top, you really get rocked with, "What is my worth from my performance?" That's what I thought. I might not have stated it that way, but it's in fact where it came from. And the Lord went deeply to work to grow me so that I came to know that my worth was in Him, not in my performance. Yes, I wanted to do my best and work unto Him. That time of struggle, which many Stanford students go through and other students, PhD students, the long, long run, we were just hearing about and hearing that in the last week where it's a long haul and there are many failures and false starts along with some successes.

It really sifts and sorts who you are and where your worth comes from. The Lord does a massive growth in the lives of believers through that.

I have been able to share about my academic experience at Stanford. It has given so much comfort and encouragement to others. I, in fact, flunked chemistry the first time through.

I remember going for the father-daughter walk with my father out at my grandparents along the canal. I was trembling in my boots and praying, knowing the question was going to come: "So how are things going academically?"

Sure enough, there came the question. I gulped and prayed and told him I flunked chemistry. He knew with a twinkle in his eye that I couldn't see yet to let me roast a little bit. There was silence while I'm squirming inside. Then he burst out laughing.

He said, "You know... I'm a doctor, I've been in medicine for most of my career, and you know what? I flunked chemistry also and it hasn't made a hoot of difference!" I went to the Lord for my worth and then my relationship with my father, and it actually brought me closer to my father. It was the Lord's sweet care in the midst of a very painful time.

But the question is, how do you hear that comfort and counsel? Because just in the last week with various counseling situations I heard, "I am praying, I am seeking to connect with the Lord in this tough time, but I am not hearing Him." How do we connect with that comfort and counsel?

It takes being in the Word regularly. It's not just going to come out of blue sky. The Lord does do that occasionally in desperate situations. We knew someone who was about to commit suicide and the Lord graciously had flaming letters show up on her wall telling her to read a book that was not Christian, but the closest thing pointing her in that direction that was in the house. She was completely isolated and began her journey to come to the Lord.

Usually the way to cultivate hearing Him, hearing His comfort and His counsel is to be in the Word yourself regularly, every day—not as "I need to have my quiet time so I can check off my duty because I'm a good Christian," but "I want to be there to meet with the Lord, to hear Him, to get to know Him." I pray from Scripture to the Lord. It’s like a window to Him where I get to know Him. It’s like the Eastern Orthodox icons, except this is Scripture where He self-describes. We get to see how He works with real people like me and get to hear His priorities, His word.

As we cultivate that and welcome it and grow, then when we’re in the midst and it’s very difficult to hear Him because the Lord seems a million miles away, like a telescope flipped in the wrong direction, and the circumstances are huge and the Lord seems minute and we don’t feel like we’re reaching Him. But if you’ve been in the word regularly and growing from it and connecting with the Lord through it, then as the Lord promised, the Holy Spirit will guide you into all the truth.

He can’t guide you into truth you haven’t exposed yourself to. The best way to be hearing Him is listening intently to His word, praying from it, seeking, growing, seeking to respond regularly. When you’re in crisis and you don’t know what’s going on or even little stuff, but you’re just grabbed by the, "I don’t know what to do." The Lord, the Holy Spirit has a lot of truth that He can bring to your mind and He’ll often bring a phrase or even just a few words. You can cross reference to that passage and do it and ask, and then read the context so that the Lord can speak more broadly. You will find He will counsel you from that Scripture.

If you can’t find something, ask somebody who is walking closely with the Lord, knows the word, and ask where in Scripture they would find counsel for what you’re going through. You get to benefit directly by the Holy Spirit and from other people. It’s all equipping to be able to come alongside of others.

Once you do that, the Lord will start bringing you people who need to hear exactly what you’ve just learned. We’ve even had brand new baby believers who, as an elder, shared a need, came up afterwards and said, I know what to do about that. It was the one verse they knew, but it was exactly what that elder needed to hear and be reminded of.

At that point, it was the Lord speaking. We get to come alongside and be part of the Lord’s work to comfort and to counsel. In this block, the point is, it doesn’t matter what the issue is. We do have resources from our own walk with the Lord, no matter how young, new, or how mature, how long we’ve been walking with the Lord. Whatever we have come to know of the Lord and His working is always valuable to every believer.

It doesn’t matter if you’re not able even to address anything about the specifics of the concern that the person has shared. You can express what you know of the Lord, and it will apply. Everything we get to know of the Lord applies throughout life. We are assured that there are lots of hard experiences in life. Verse 5: **"Just as the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance, so also our comfort is abundant through Christ."** It's everywhere, and that's an encouragement to us that the Lord promises to match every bit of affliction with His comfort and counsel. We are never without a resource. And a lot of times believers don't understand that.

The afflictions, the suffering, is abundant. This is a broken world. And a lot of times believers coming to the Lord think, "Now my life is going to be great, easy, delightful, full of joy and joy." But Scripture is very realistic that we live in a broken world, and even within the church believers are growing but coming out of a lot that is not from the Lord, and so it shows up in the church as well.

Instead of being surprised and rocked by it and turned off by it, it's recognizing that the Lord promises to match every bit of it with His comfort and counsel, and that's so encouraging.

Now we move to another aspect, verses six and seven: **"If we're afflicted, it's for your comfort and salvation; or if we're comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effective in the patient enduring of the same sufferings we also suffer. And our hope for you is firmly grounded, knowing it is your share of our sufferings, so also you are of our comfort."**

We move from the general application to the specific application. This is a reason why I want to take advantage of every opportunity to grow and learn from the Lord and to see Him meet my needs. In every area that I see Him working to meet my needs, as I entrust that area to Him, I am gaining firsthand experience and testimony about how God works in that kind of a situation.

It is even more effective if I can respond to somebody sharing something that's really weighing on them and they're struggling with by saying, "I know at least something about what you're going through because I've been through similar." Of course, I haven't been through exactly what you're going through, but I've been through similar. I've seen God work in that kind of a situation because He's worked in that kind of a situation in my life.

Sharing about circumstances I went through, not in the "Oh, well, you're going through that. Oh, I've been through that," and all the focus goes on me. That does not really help the person who is struggling. But knowing that somebody has firsthand experience in the same arena, even though not exactly the same in all the details, is a great encouragement. It's not just talking in generalities. Again, it's helpful to know that each thing we go through is specific. The Lord is offering specific comfort and counsel and specific equipping for other people. That gives purpose to the suffering. It's not that suffering has value in and of itself, but that the Lord wants to use it for equipping if I’m willing. If I don’t just implode into "woe is me, I hate this, I don’t want to be here, why am I here?" If that's my approach or just collapsing into depression, then I won’t learn very much.

If I thank the Lord, even through my tears, and say, "Teach me, help me to grow, help me to hear Your comfort and counsel, especially from Your Word, as well as by Your Spirit, Your Spirit through Your Word, as well as directly and through others, and equip me through it to help others," I will learn a lot. Then I will have a lot of specific opportunities.

An example: I have been through a lot medically in the last few years. I’ve got metal in my wrist, in my elbow, torn biceps tendon and rotator cuffs and surgery from that. Then a year and a half ago, fluid on the lungs and in my heart, which can be fatal.

I would not have chosen to sign up for any of these things or the pain that came through fixing it, let alone the injury, which was massive, especially with the shoulder. Instead of just getting angry, "Lord, how could this happen?" or "I’m just imploding into it, I feel miserable," and staying there, I said, "Okay, thank you, Lord. I would never have chosen this or signed up for it. But I know from this passage, it’s training time. And I don’t want to miss You. I don’t want to miss Your presence and Your speaking to me directly. And I don’t want to miss the training to help others."

As I did that, especially with this last one with the fluid on the heart and the lungs, I was in the hospital for four days and it looked like it was going to be a lot longer. It seemed eternal. I couldn’t sleep, in pain, awake in the night as well as the day. I had a roommate who was very loud about her needs and pains, and also right across from the nurse’s station. They were partying all night too, I think, to stay awake and encourage each other in between all their care.

I got to go to the Lord and just thank Him, trust Him, ask to hear Him, and also be available to serve right there. And as you know, from those who know the story , I ended up with a traveling nurse. It was her last night on my last night. She ended up seeing the Holy Spirit within me, even though I looked like a wreck, hadn’t seen a brush in four days, and so on. She recognized the life of the Lord. She ended up sharing how weary she was. I said, well, I know what to do with weary. "Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I quoted all of the "Take my yoke, the yoke upon you and learn from me," word for word, disciple. "And you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my yoke is gentle and light." I'm paraphrasing, which you should never do.

She just started to weep. I was asked if I could pray for her, which I got to do at midnight. Then she said, "I wish we could hug each other." I said, "Well, why not?" So I jumped out of bed, tubes and all, gave her a big bear hug and said, "You know, this hug is from God." She said, "I know," tears running down both of our cheeks.

I got to equip her from Scripture. She was headed home to a different state and going to be looking for a church. I gave her Scripture to read. If that was the immediate purpose, if that was it for all of that, it was worth it.

The equipping the Lord gave me then was equipping that I could have come alongside many with. I used to serve as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital, and I've had many chances since to come alongside former students who are post-surgical with lots of pain and complications or who are dying and getting to bring the Lord's specific comfort and counsel.

He is always equipping us if we're thanking Him and eager to receive, eager to grow. Then He will bring us opportunity after opportunity where He is wanting to work and we get to be the ones, as part of His body, to express Him in specifics from the Scriptures that He's spoken to us.

There are countless opportunities, and you come out dancing, getting to be part of the living God coming alongside people in need. Every one of us is surrounded by people in need if we are alert to the Holy Spirit and alert to those who are hungry and would like to know more.

This is real. It is promised if we go for it with thanksgiving and trust and listening and walking in what He shows us.

It is helpful to know the sufferings are abundant, and in the sufferings of Christ, some of that is just raw persecution. I am seeking to be of help to a refugee in desperate straits in Turkey. But it also happens here. Then getting to encourage others who are going through it as well.

Our comfort is abundant, not just the suffering. And counsel is abundant.

Then the next thing that Paul does is he shares with these people about how the Lord has been working specifically in his life. Verses 8 and 9:

**"We do not want you to be unaware, brothers, of our affliction which came in Asia, that is Asia Minor, that we were burdened excessively beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. Indeed, we have the sense of death within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead."** It really helps if people who are trying to encourage in the Lord hear something about other people's experiences—not just piling all of our stuff on top of the stuff they're already struggling under, but in being real, not just being the academic or scholarly or professional caregiver with what in secular counseling is referred to as clinical detachment—the importance of not getting too engaged personally.

It helps people to know about how the Lord is working in other people's lives and what kind of seemingly dire straits we've been in and how the Lord worked.

Yes, we are overwhelmed. That's normal. But God is never overwhelmed. He is with us always. Jesus promised that to the disciples. Paul references it in various of his letters, such as Philippians 4, verse 4. It is helpful for people to hear testimony of that.

I was beyond my limits, but I was not beyond the Lord's limits. I was not beyond the limits of my Heavenly Father, not beyond the limits of my Lord Jesus. The pressure I was under was to pressure me into turning to the Lord and trusting this and trusting the situation to Him who is able to do what I can't and is eager to do what I can't, and His way which may or may not be what I envision.

I may make suggestions to Him in prayer of how I think He would do well to address this situation because I think that would be good for me. There are times when He says, no, no, I've got better than that. That may be good, but that's not good enough. Let Me show you how I'm able to work way beyond what you would imagine from what you've experienced to date.

At the end of chapter three of Ephesians, Paul is wrapping up the discourse on God's equipping for interpersonal relationships and then moving into, okay, now how do we—how do we live and work our way through the challenges of interpersonal relationships? He prays to the One who is able to do "exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think according to the power that works within us."

I like to quote from a pastor who was very influential in my equipping, especially for counseling. I remember hearing Bob Roe in a memorial service say, and of course, in a memorial service, there are lots of unbelievers who are there, mostly out of a sense of social obligation. They'd rather be elsewhere, but they better show up for whoever is now gone and pay my respects.

He said, "People ask me what heaven is like." He had a lot of attention all of a sudden. "I'll tell you. I don't know." It's not that I don't know a lot about what heaven is like, but I know it's beyond that. In fact, this text says it's "exceedingly beyond that. Not only that, it's exceedingly abundantly beyond that." That includes everything I could ask or think.

So what is heaven like? Way, way beyond our wildest expectations about what is actually good and what is truly light. And so we have this sentence of death in the form of, I don't have what it takes to handle this within ourselves in order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead. That no matter how bad it is, and dead is about as bad as it gets, no matter how bad it is, He can raise Himself out of it. And He does.

And then Paul goes on. Just a couple of examples. Sometimes the Lord brings up things before a ministry opportunity that you don't have.

Decades ago, we were working with a team in Hungary and they got in contact and said they had someone on the team who was deeply depressed. He was actually bipolar and kind of jumping between extremes, but unrealistic in all of it.

We said, we're planning to come as you requested and do some more teaching among you this summer. They said, that's not soon enough. We need you now. Could you please come help if this is causing real mayhem among the whole staff and making our ministry very difficult?

We prayed and a Christian businessman said, I'll fund your going. Steve was getting set to leave to come alongside this man and the team. Steve got deeply depressed before going. It wasn't that it came out of nowhere. It felt like it.

The Lord will use things where we still get to grow. I can't remember what it was, but whatever it was, Steve got very depressed and we were praying. He didn't come out of it until just a day or two before getting on the plane. He was still kind of barely out.

On the plane to go, he ended up meeting with the team that first evening and shared openly what he had just been going through.

They asked, how are you doing? So I told them. And I told them that I'd been deeply depressed just before the time of coming over. And what the Lord did, how He reached into me and how He brought me out of the miry depths.

That was the Lord's preparation to be able to talk with this staff, because it told him that Steve understood and that he wouldn't be condemning: what's wrong with you, why aren't you cheerful in Jesus? But instead, here in Christian ministry, you should be cheerful, you should be on top of things, you should have everything together. You shouldn't be down in the dumps. That's a bad example for people.

Instead, Steve's open, vulnerable sharing and sharing how the Lord had resolved it opened the door for ministry to this man and the team. It happens as you pray for missionaries. This sort of thing is a regular occurrence. You're going to be on the front lines and you get hit hard.

We had a counseling pastor who was phenomenal. He actually was one of the team that married us. It took a team. When Erica appeared, I was halfway out of the blocks before I realized I can't run up and give her a big hug. I have to wait until she gets there. I imagine that as they saw me start to lunge, the two pastors who were co-officiating probably both took a dive for me, but the Lord checked me before they did. This is not that situation. No, it was one of those two pastors.

He was on his way out to teach in a conference in the Far East. The church had given him and his wife a week's vacation in Hawaii before he would leave. He got decked with deep depression during that week. It was no vacation.

When they arrived in Hawaii, the team arrived to pick him up and continue on. He said, "You guys have to go. I can't go. I can't go with you. I'm just so totally wiped out." Then Tim said, "Oh, all right." They went to work and they prayed and they shared and he came out of it and was very, very effective ministry.

As you pray for those who are on the front lines, including us, which we so appreciate, people on the front lines get hit hard with extra spiritual warfare. "But God...", but the Lord uses it for equipping. That's what Paul is sharing here.

Here, the great apostle gets hit with despair. It was actually over the Corinthians. It was over a misunderstanding. He didn't share the why here. It was just, he was hit hard and was despairing of life because, and you find out from the letter, it was a difficult misunderstanding with the church and that he despaired even of life.

He says he wasn't even able to minister when there was an open door for ministry. He was so just imploded in the despair. Had his ministry been in vain? The Lord used that in order—

Why does He let us go through things like this? "In order that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead."

I remember learning this from the Lord right after giving birth to our second. I had torn as in getting the baby out and was in a lot of pain for weeks and weeks afterwards while nursing a newborn and caring for our six-year-old and doing ministry. I remember just being in despair of, "Lord, am I ever going to get well?" Just that feeling it's never going to end.

The Lord took me to these verses and said, "Let me show you why. It's in order that you should not trust in yourself, but in God who raises the dead." That was so encouraging. It was, "Oh, thank you, Lord. That's the answer." It actually picked me up so much that I felt like I healed from that point on pretty quickly.

That was when He pointedly taught me this message and has continued to over the years. And what we see in the rest of this letter is there was a very difficult situation going on in the church at Corinth and Paul had written a letter intended to bring about healing and reconciliation. Instead, they took it as condemnation. When the congregation took it as a signal that they were to climb all over this guy and work him over, which is not what Paul intended at all. They thought Paul was upset with them.

As he says, there was an open door for ministry. I couldn't go through it. I had to connect with those who were coming from Corinth because I had to know the reality of what was happening. Before that, he trusted in God who raises the dead, who always leads us in His triumph, and who heals and strengthens us, usually apart from the situation while we're still in the midst, before then dealing with the situation that was causing the difficulty. Because the key is that we learn to trust in Him for life and not another thing or people.

He says in verse 10, "Who delivered us from so great a death and will deliver us, in whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us." So he's done it in the past. He's doing it now with the current issues. He will keep doing it in the future, no matter what issues come up.

In verse 11, "You also joining in helping us through your prayers. The thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the favor bestowed on us through many." This is really key: prayer support.

Now, it's very important that whatever prayer support—prayer support for those seeking to minister to others, prayer support for those they're seeking to minister to—that the sharing of the prayer request and prayer concerns needs to be in the context of absolute preservation of privacy and anonymity. Churches are ripped apart by things that people share with others under the label of "so-and-so needs prayer." You wouldn't believe what so-and-so has been doing, and so forth. It is very, very important. We emphasize this, we try to mention it periodically: do not ever share anything with anyone about something that the person of concern has not either declared publicly—so the person himself or herself has made it public information—or you have explicit permission from that person. Not just a general kind of okay, but explicit permission that it is okay for you to tell this person or these people or anybody about this.

If so, stick within the limits of what they have told you is okay to share. God knows the details. God does not need to know from you or from somebody you're talking with, sharing the concern with, because you genuinely care for the person of concern. God does not need to have you say who it is you're praying about. And you may be praying for somebody. You don't know who it is. But you may be praying for somebody with thus and such an issue going on. You don't need to know who it is. When you pray, you can just reference, "Lord, I want to pray for the person that Joe Blow mentioned, who's struggling with whatever is specific," but nothing beyond that.

And it's really important. People assume that, "Oh, the person I'm talking to and the person I'm talking about will never connect with each other." Don't kid yourself. You would be amazed at some of the accounts that we have heard of something that someone shared with someone about someone else getting around to the person it was about or to someone who will know from the details included who it is and shouldn't know about it.

You don't ever want to be in the position where two people meet. We literally have known of two people who one would never expect would meet each other, meeting each other halfway around the globe under bizarre circumstances. This is not something we've heard once; we've heard a number of instances. It's really amazing.

What we take as a guideline is: I don't ever want to be talking to anybody about anyone and have that person be able to say, "Well, you haven't said who it is, but you mentioned enough specifics that I'm sure I know who it is," or "I think I know who it is." You never want to be in that position.

Let people tell their own story. Keep quiet about what's private to people. She said, go into your closet, close the door, and talk to the Lord about it. That's how it's going to be effective.

It's very easy for people—and this is part of where you get gossip stuff going in the church—to spend much more time asking people to pray for so-and-so about this terrible thing that's going on than they spend actually praying. The question always is: if you spent the time that you spend asking somebody else to pray about this, if you spent that time praying, how much more prayer would get done than as a result of your asking other people to pray about it?

It's helpful to have that confidence that no matter what is going on, God loves to raise from the dead and to deliver us from so great a peril of death and will deliver us. He on whom we've set our hope, and he will yet deliver us. We have a God who loves to come to the rescue and who loves to work even in horrendous circumstances.

As he has been saying earlier in the passage, it's for equipping to help others as well as direct ministry from Him to us. An example of this is we have a friend who has done a lot of work in missions in some very dark places in Africa. She was equipped to help women recover who had survived attempted genocide, where they had seen their family spread gruesomely all over the walls of their house. And how do you go on? How do you remake a life? How do you rebuild after something that extreme? The confidence here—I mentioned an example of that—there's a situation we didn't know any of the individuals involved where exactly that's what happened. The husband was murdered and then the murderers put pieces of his body all over the house.

What a thing to come home to. And no surprise, she just went into a total catatonic state. She came in to find that. She was unable to communicate. She was just as rigid, stiff as a board. They carried her to the church and gathered a group around that just prayed and read Scripture, especially read Scripture. They just read Scripture hour after hour. Around the clock, somebody was constantly reading Scripture to this woman.

It took a long time, but she came out of it. It's the word of God and it's got Himself and it's turning to Him that there, and, by the way, death takes many, many forms. There's not just physical death.

A lot of times when Scripture talks about death, it's not talking about physical death. It's talking about the death of separation from God, of having to try to make it through life without the God who designed us and who created this life for us to walk through it with Him. And that's what makes all the difference.

It doesn't matter what the situation is. God is the life giver. He not only gives life, but also then uses it to equip, to help others.

This example of a friend of ours who has worked with genocide survivors: she had a group of women who had survived, to help them rebuild a life after just a shattering experience and season. Within the group, there were two witch doctors, and one of them got mad at somebody else in the group and started throwing curses on her.

One of the other witch doctors said, "Wait a minute, we have covenanted in this group to be for each other, and you're throwing curses on her?" She ended up, the one who was questioning this, ended up coming to the Lord.

Part of the healing of people who have survived genocide, as with other extreme situations and less than that, as this passage is saying, is to be equipped and then help others. It's part of their own healing to help others who have been through a similar situation and to come alongside with the understanding and with the hope and the encouragement in the Lord. And that's part of their healing as well as getting to help others. And it's true here. Women have been sex trafficked. It's true not only of extremes, but even the things of our daily lives as we've been talking about. The confidence that just as you share in our suffering, so also you share in our comfort and counsel, that the Lord meets us and guarantees to do that as we're willing to receive what He wants to say and wants to do and go with Him rather than just get angry that we're in that situation or just implode because we're there.

Instead, place our hope in the One who raises from the dead and who loves to deliver, He on whom we've set our hope, and you also joining and helping through your prayers, that thanks may be given by many on our behalf for the favor bestowed upon us through the prayers of many.

As we're going through things and we ask for prayer from others, then all of us are in the front row seat to see God at work. And that's the beauty of it. Instead of saying, "Oh, I don't want to bother people," or "I feel like I can't ask for prayer," it may be something that you want to ask just one or two close friends who will encourage you, count on to keep it confidential, and to pray.

That is the Lord answering through the prayers of many or few. When it's something that I can share, the people that I share with who pray are in the front row seat with me to see what God will do. So we're all encouraged.

No matter what we're going through, it's not just for us. It is, at least generically, equipping to be of generic health, real health. Generic doesn't mean it's not real. It's just on the level of the things that are common to all the kinds of struggles that we go through. Then there's specific equipping for specific things.

Years ago, early days of the ministry, we would often pray as something came up, "Lord, who's this for?" We had a sense of the need to dig into the Word and get the answers on this because we had the sense there's probably somebody who really needs this, that we're going to come into contact with, the Lord's going to bring into contact with us very soon. We need to be prepared.

It's amazing how often that actually happened very clearly, where the connection with what the Lord has walked us through was very clear. So this is a jam of a passage. We encourage each of us to keep going to it for hope, for comfort, for counsel, and equipping to help others.

Just as Paul here gives the testimony and personal report and so forth, so what is it? It's about what's happening between him and that church. What comes out of it is Paul explains how his ministry works. That's 2 Corinthians 2:14 to 7:3.

It's fascinating. If you read through 2:13 and jump to 7:4, you don't see any gap. There's no sense anything was left out. So grand excursus, which is the whole point, what the Lord has taught Paul. He said, "You know, I had no peace because I didn't find Titus and I didn't get the report." And then at 7:4, having been talking all about the principles of ministry and how to minister to others, he suddenly says, "But then with the coming of Titus and the report that everything's fine between you and us." It's amazing. Sometimes I sit down and read it and just make that jump. The beautiful thing about it is it's a demonstration in this letter of how God uses election—that we go through and are turning to Him and walking through it with Him—to bless many others. Countless people have been greatly blessed through this letter and that explanation from 2:14 to 7:3, which is a description of ministry in general, the dynamics of how ministry works, and specifically of the counseling ministry.

Enjoy reading it and letting the Lord give you more equipping out of this text.

For any who were not here at the beginning, for the rest of this quarter, we will be looking at Romans and other passages about how to actually change. If it's a review for you, we understand it much better now, and hopefully it will result in real growth and equipping to help others.

This is the material, especially for moments. We will be in the text as well as other texts and also to understand what are the underlying issues that need to be addressed, no matter what the specific growth issue is, to set us free to actually grow.

Our goal is twofold: one, for all of our growth and encouragement, and then also for equipping so that you can explain from these passages to many others that the Lord will bring you alongside.

We are looking forward to the quarter together.

For those who want to stick in, we'd love to share in God's sightings—however the Lord spoke to you, showed Himself to you during the break—or, of course, a question about the passage we were just in, or an example of it.

Let's pray.

> Lord, thank You that You do speak and You do act in the midst of the real stresses and challenges of life in a broken world, whether it comes from our own choices or the choices of others, or just what's going on nationally, internationally, the environment, whatever the cause. Thank You that You are right here to comfort and to counsel us and use that as specific equipping to come alongside many others in our lives where You draw us along, call us alongside, so we can share with them what has given us hope and new life and moving forward with more life than we had before. Thank You for each one of our brothers and sisters. Use this passage for equipping, for encouragement, for growth, and for walking with You who are above as we deal with the many, many challenges in this life. In Your name, amen.
