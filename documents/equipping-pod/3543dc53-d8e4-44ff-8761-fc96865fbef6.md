> Oh Lord, thank You that You are our living God, that we pray and You hear. You're not just a philosophy, You're not remote or distant; You are right here and You love us and You are good.

> Thank You that You're knowable and predictable. Thank You that You reveal Your character. You reveal the way You work. And You've created us in Your image to show You forth, to walk with You in Your ways, and to bring Your presence to the brokenness in this world, to messy situations.

> Thank You that though we often don't know the way, You do. You are the way. And may we walk step by step with You and see You.

> Thank You that the challenging times, the hard parts, as we trust You, are the places where we get to know You the best. And so do others watching, hearing.

> So Lord, we ask that You will speak to each of us tonight. That You will use tonight for encouragement and for insight, how to walk closer with You for growth and for service.

> Thank You, Lord, in Your name. Amen.


In the last couple weeks, we were able to look at the downward spiral in Romans, and then we looked at the upward spiral last week, and we saw three exchanges on the way down, exchanging what the Lord has called us to, and our call to glorify Him for a counterfeit.

At the end of that exchange, we're in a place where we're walling the Lord out, either overall for unbelievers or for believers it's often in a specific area.

Then we looked last week at the upward spiral where the Lord really gives hope because of His unwavering commitment to us. As a result of having been justified by faith, we see that we have peace with Him and we have grace and can stand in His presence because of the Lord and His favor.

Then Lord so often uses those tribulations as the means by which we get to learn how to trust Him more and more. And as we do, and as we obtain that proven character, it leads to greater hope that "Lord, You are helping me to grow and we are getting there!" And we looked a little bit about grace versus law, and grace enables the joy of making progress. Grace measures from zero versus law measuring how far you're falling from perfection. Because of the Lord's grace, each little step that we take through the tribulation and perseverance and proven character is a step towards what the Lord has committed that He is going to complete in every one of our lives.

Then we looked at how the result is we get to boast in the Lord Himself because of His love and what He has done and what He is doing and what we are confident He will do. That is the spiral upward.

We noticed that there are three exchanges on the way down and three boasts on the way up. We have also noted that there are three steps. So there's something of a pattern here.

For today's class, we wanted to focus a bit on the question of why these three. Steve has done a lot of research as he has been in the text, and the Lord has shown him and opened up the foundational paradigm, which is how the Lord communicates in both the Old Testament and in the New Testament.

We see it in the creation as well, as well as in church history and the Godhead and many, many examples. It is really helpful to understand how these three elements work because it's how the Lord communicates. It's how a lot of life works. Well, perhaps even how all of life works.

And it's really important to understand in order to be able to take the three steps effectively and be able to gain insight into the different things that we face in our own lives. And as the Lord brings others around us and we have opportunities to help them, it's really helpful to have this in mind for that as well.

So now we go back to Genesis 1. Somebody last night pointed out what we have gone to in Genesis 1, which is so helpful to see this pattern. What we see throughout actually is that God does everything in three dimensions. There are three parts to everything that God does as we look in Genesis 1.

We have noted everything He does. He starts with deliberate intentional purpose, then He proceeds to execute that purpose in practice, and then He imparts the resultant blessing to the intended beneficiaries, or at least offers it to them. In Genesis 1, before the fall, He just imparts it.

This is God's nature. We are created in the image of God, which means that we are to be living expressions of Him. In order to be living expressions of Him, we need to do things the way He does it. And it's not just the way He does things in Genesis 1. First we see this, and in each of the days of the creation God starts with a statement of purpose and then He proceeds to make it happen in practice and then there's the result. It's all those same three steps. Everything He does follows that same pattern.

We look at the Godhead. Why are there three persons in the Godhead? What is the Father's role? Purpose. Calling. Initiation.

What is the Son's role? Administration. Management. Rule.

It is commonly believed that God the Father is the creator. It's not true. When we get to the New Testament, we're told in several places, Colossians 1, John 1 for example, that Jesus is the executive manager who makes the Father's will happen. Jesus is the administrator. He's the CEO if you want to think about it in those terms. The Father is the chairman of the board. The board is the three members of the Godhead.

And then the Spirit is about relationship and guidance and empowering for relationships. Three aspects of our existence. We have relationship.

We've come down to Genesis 1, 26 to 28. And there's an example right there.

"26 And God said, Let us," and you might note there, the Hebrew for us is let us, it's plural, and it's unlike English. Hebrew has actually three forms for number, but the dual is used only for things that occur naturally in pairs. So two eyes, two feet, two hands, for example, that's a dual form.

And it can be inferred. It doesn't necessarily have to be. But even I understand rabbinical scholars prior to the proclamation of the gospel, prior to the incarnation, saw this statement, let us, as being evidence that God is at least three. And they didn't say at least, they just said three. That became very unpopular as the Christian era unfolded, not surprisingly.

"But let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule." In our image, which is essence. According to our likeness, that's function. And let them rule, that is impartation of responsibility to them. That's a relational thing.

And then you have the three things. You have the statement of purpose in Genesis 1:26. You have the execution of that purpose in fact in 27. And in 28, you have the impartation of resultant blessing. So 1:27. So each of those three verses together makes up this pattern.

Now within that, verse 27 itself: "So God created man in His own image," who is the only one who can look at a human being and see an expression of His own image, only God. "In the image of God He created him." So God is not, God is in the third person there, so is the reference to the man, him. It's third person. So this is the observer is not God. The observer is not the human being, but some other observer. And we have to stick within the context of the text if we want to understand it. People immediately start saying, "Who’s the observer?" Some say the angels. All right, show me the reference to angels. There isn’t any. Who are the possible observers in what we have been told from the Scripture text? The animals. There are observers who are to look at human beings and see an expression of God, of God’s nature and function.

"Male and female, He created them." Again, "He" is a third person reference. And "them" (again third person) the male and female. So what do we have? We have the observers as part of a relationship.

So we see the same thing. And throughout Genesis 1, one triad after another, everything God does has three parts. Not infrequently, we are given a closer look into one of those parts, and it has three parts. This is the triadic fractal nature of everything about God and His creation, including us.

With us, the three parts are spirit, which is motivation, the seat of motivation, referred to as heart in human terms. The spirit, body, and soul will come in later. We have three parts. We have a part corresponding to God. We have a part corresponding to the physical creation—our physical bodies. We have a part that has to do with relationship, the personal dimension of life, technically the soul. It’s all three-dimensional. It’s always the same three elements, though occurring in many various manifestations. The principle of the relationship between the three is always the same.

It is no surprise when it comes to changing from who we are born to be naturally, because we’ve inherited from the fall the natural, sinful human nature. To move from living on the basis of that, which we find in the New Testament refers to as the flesh as opposed to the spirit, because that is what we are naturally—leaving God out of the picture.

Actually, the flesh doesn’t just leave God out of the picture. The flesh fights to keep God out of the picture. The nature of the flesh is "I do" itself. The nature of the flesh is "I recognize I’m God-like." So that’s all I need. If I’m God-like, I can just function as God.

It’s not just that I can ignore God, but the flesh, explicitly stated in Galatians 5, "the flesh wars against the spirit. Actually, it's the flesh lusts. The flesh is compelled to fight against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh. The spirit is compelled to fight against the flesh because God, being righteous, must combat unrighteousness, sin, in order to be righteous.

Salvation is about moving from living a lifestyle that leaves God out, moreover tries to shut God out, to living a lifestyle in relationship with God as God’s beloved, faithful servant and ally in purpose and warfare. When we come to actually seeking to change our lifestyle from what comes naturally, which is ungodly, it's God-like, but it's ungodly in what it pursues. When we come to that, we need to change in all three of those regards.

And that is why when the Lord explains to us through Paul in the heart of Romans the mechanics of changing from life according to the flesh to life according to the Spirit. That change, that transformation, must be done in three dimensions. It needs to happen on the level of our purpose, our objective. It needs to happen in terms of what we're doing in practice, what we are serving to further in practice. And it needs to be done on the level of relationship—intimacy with Father and Son.

Notice when Jesus explains what eternal life is for us, as quoted in John 17:3, **"This is eternal life, that they may know you,** [he's praying to the Father] **the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."** He doesn't say that they may know you, Father, Father, and the Son, and the Spirit. Why not? Because it's by the agency of the Holy Spirit living in the believer that we are able to get to know Father and Son intimately.

Redeemed relationships with God is an expression, a dynamic of the Godhead, all three members; only it's not three out there. It is easy for genuine believers to think of God out there, meaning the Father, the Son, Jesus out there, and the Spirit out there. No.

The Father is external to me. The Son is external to me. But the Spirit is dwelling in me and reproducing God's life within me.

As we pursue sanctification, that is having our lives become what God designed and intends them to be, we are engaging as closely as we possibly can in the dynamic of the Trinity without actually being God. There is no possible way of being closer to being God without actually being God.

All three of these aspects have to be addressed to bring about change. We need to let God change the purpose about any issue, any element of our lives, any and every element. We need to change what we have been pursuing as our objective, as our goal, into what God's objective for us is.

Romans 1 says they exchanged, they exchanged, they exchanged. Three exchanges. Note that those three exchanges are exactly the same three that we've seen and been referring to in Genesis 1.

They exchanged what God reveals about Himself for images, false images, conceptual images of what would seem to be better than the God who is and the way He works. They exchanged the truth of God for the lie.

This is administrative. What is the lie? "I do it self." This is spiritual DIY, which is not effective. If you're talking about home repairs, DIY can be great if you know what you're doing or if you're willing to learn. But in relationship to God, DIY doesn't work. So they exchanged godly relations or ungodly ones.

What are the three steps of change, of sanctification? Getting our purpose, our objective, our goal in line with the Lord. Accepting His calling and His declaration of purpose for me in place of what I've been pursuing.

We have to change what we're doing. And we get into there talking about slavery and service. The Greek has one term that's used both for slave and for servant. There are other terms for service, but one of the same term is used for them.

So it's the nature of it. If you're a slave, you've been taken captive, kidnapped slavery. You have no choice. You're a slave because of economic slavery. So you have to do what you've sold yourself to demands.

But the question is, what is your doing furthering, serving to further? Is it to further the calling to which God's called you? Or is it furthering your own thing? Which by definition will not result in life, though it appears to, and that's why I pursue my own thing.

We have to exchange our corrupt approach to relationships for the real thing. The way God does relationships.

This is not just Paul's thing. It's not, "I'm Paul, I'm Peter, I'm Apollos." We're all one with the Lord. It's not doing my own thing.

We need to reverse, but not merely reverse, but supersede the exchanges of Genesis 1, the exchange of the fall. We're not just trying to get back to the garden, though heaven is described as a garden, but it's very, very different from the garden in the creation.

The garden in the creation was perfect, but it's not good enough for God, for us. He wants much more, much more than was there in the original creation.

The fall and then redemption from the fall worked out in sanctification in practice is a transformation to a far higher state than the state that Adam was in as the sinless first human being.

It has been helpful for me to recognize: in the garden, it was perfection and *obedience*. After the fall, as the Lord calls us into sanctification, it's now the *obedience of faith*.

It's just two more words added to the end there, but they make the world of difference. Because it's the obedience of faith, the relationship and the depth of knowing our Lord and all that He went through, and what His heart is about.

Appreciation, love, thanksgiving, joy, it's just so much deeper, and so much greater than it was when it was merely obedience.

The call at the beginning of Romans, obedience of faith, we can sometimes feel, "Oh, that's the challenging part. That's the hard part." I think the Lord looks at it and says, "That's the most valuable part".

And bear in mind, faith is not what you get from polls, but it always comes out that 90-something percent of Americans believe in God. It's not biblical belief. Most of them think, "Do you believe in God?" "Well, yeah, I suppose there is a God, so I'll say yes." That's not what it's talking about. It's talking about trust.

The term faith, noun form, and believe, verb form, all come from a root meaning to be persuaded, to be convinced in the Greek.

Adam obeyed God because that's the way he was made. If it hadn't been for the interference of the adversary, the tempter, the accuser, he would have just gone on doing exactly what God designed him to do. That's the way the loyal angels operate.

We're told in Scripture that they are mystified, dumbfounded by what they're watching. I'm elaborating on what scripture says here, but "the things into which angels long to look," is what Scripture says. It's a mystery to them. I think that means in part that, being naturally obedient, they look and say, will grace work if you don't have to obey? Will they?

It looks like no, definitely not. But they watch the course of it. Then it's astonishingly magnificent because it moves us to cooperating with God, allying with God in the battle of warfare against sin, which is an attack against God and us and His creation of us in His image.

The adversary is determined to destroy us if he possibly can. He does everything to try to make that happen. It is warfare.

We find, as we look at the three steps, the issue with step one is warfare. The issue with step two is functional activity. The issue with step three is interpersonal relationship with God and each other. We can't pull it up by doing just one of these or two of them. It has to be all three.

How do we change? A lot of times believers wanting to change: I'm motivated. I know that my approach in this area is just not displaying the Lord. Usually, we start with behavior.

"I'm just not going to get angry anymore." We know that you say in James 1:20 , "The anger of man does not accomplish the righteousness of God." I can never encourage someone to grow in the Lord through my anger, though we all try it in different ways. Just put a little pressure on to get you to move.

We may be genuinely praying and determined, and then we do it again. The other people around us, as well as the accuser in our heads, are saying, "See, you'll never change," which is a flat-out lie of the adversary. If you are the new creation, the Lord Himself promises, "I will complete what I've begun." Philippians 1:6 and 1 Thessalonians 5 say, "Faithful is he who called you, and he also will bring it to pass."

So we have the Lord Himself promising that we will change. We have a lot to do with how fast it happens and understanding how.

Many times we focus on just the behavior and then we get so discouraged because we're sincere. "I will to do this," but then I don't, which is what Paul says in Romans 7.

We will be getting into this in depth, learning to recognize that there isn't just me dwelling inside. Yes, as a believer, I am the new creation. The Spirit is there, but so is the flesh. As Steve has been saying, the essence of the flesh is "I'm enough. I can figure it out and no one tells me what to do."

Learning how to recognize that and take charge of it by the Spirit rather than being had by it is important.

Often, when we just try to change the behaviors, we forget that we need to get at why did I develop this pattern? Why does this sort of thing matter so much to me that I will explode or fight for this?

We don't get to what's driving it, what's behind it, which is why Paul in the downward spiral talks about exchanging the glory of God for an image. We each have a little pantheon inside. When the Holy Spirit enters, we've got a little pantheon of things that we've been living for, fighting for, or get depressed if it looks like it's not going to happen.

Those are diagnostic earmarks that I have an idol. In fact, I have a case of the idols. Most things have multiple idols that are driving them. As we pray, we'll be getting into that in specific starting next week with a lot of examples.

A quick example of an idol: in the flesh, we all want to be worshiped and feel like we're awesome. Instead of living for the glory of God, we live for the glory of self. I really want people to think I'm really something.

I will never forget walking over at Stanford and hearing two gardeners talking about, did you see so-and-so? They were practically worshiping the shadow of one of the big football players who walked by because that's where the big players lived. It was, "Oh my gosh, what a man." We all want that sort of thing in different areas.

He's a musician and he likes jazz. He was going to go to a concert. I think it was Thelonious Monk, one of the great jazz performers. He was all excited about it. His wife, who is beautifully down to earth and loves the Lord, said, "What's the big deal? He puts on his pants one leg at a time, just like everybody else." But it's easy to just be driven. I'm just giving an example, driven by really wanting to be the top, the best. And why? Because I really want to be, I'm finding my worth there. I want people to think I am awesome. And as long as I... a misdirection.

People are supposed to look at us and worship the one that they see expressed in us. The corruption of the fall is to look at me and worship me. It’s important to address why am I constantly comparing myself with others? Why am I constantly looking to see am I at the top of this group? Am I contributing the most? Because I want to be most appreciated. People get absolutely driven by this.

You have to address what's behind it. What am I fighting for? What am I fighting against to be successful? Because that will define what I do.

Then it’s easy to say, I’ve gone to the Lord about the essence of it. Lord, may my life be a pointer to You, not to me. Then I do the same thing. Why is that? Step two is then a proactive planning with the Lord, how I will live this out in practice. We’ll be looking at that. Not just behavior change, but how do I do this freely from the heart, not duty.

Romans 8 really gets into doing it by the Spirit where I take charge of the flesh within, where I take charge of my thinking, my focus, and what comes out of it. We’ll be getting into that. It takes all three steps to address single issues. Many issues have multiple idols driving them. It can feel like, oh my gosh, there’s so much to this. I’ll never get there.

Instead, every step is progress. There’s a lot of joy in every step. It doesn’t mean you’ve got to do the whole thing before there’s any progress. Each step can result in a lot. I may have changed the motivation, I may have changed the behavior, but the third question is what’s the real impact in the lives of people around me? Is it actually blessing or have I somehow missed? Is there modification that the Lord wants to make so that it’s actually getting through to the people around me? Am I actually just blessing them according to His voice?

There’s a lot here, but we have changed so much and we’ve seen the Lord change so many as you learn to address all three. We’ll be getting into the many examples of this. We begin to look at this.

Always helpful to tie it to the text as well. To look at where we’re seeing this and derive it from the text.

We will get a lot more time to look at this in depth. But we have a pretty good idea now of why these three steps and what’s essential about it. And surprise, surprise, when we look at these three steps, the Lord gives us another triad for each step. And we'll see that for each step, there is the hope and the provision that the Lord gives us in order to be able to take the step. Then there's the mechanics of taking the step itself. And then there's the fruit that results from it. Amazingly, in all three cases, the fruit is eternal life in greater and greater degree.

Before that, I wanted to sneak this in here in chapter five, something that we didn't cover in the upward spiral that has been such an encouragement to me.

We looked at the first and second boasts: first, boasting in the hope of the glory of God, and then boasting in our tribulation, knowing tribulation brings perseverance, perseverance proven character, and proven character hope.

Let me just make a comment here. I just went through our translation and substituted exalt for boast because boast is a standard—actually, it's probably the core translation of the Greek term. It's almost always negative, and it is used that way in Scripture. But because of the Lord's work in salvation, our confidence shifts from being in ourselves and our accomplishments, DIY, our accomplishments in something apart from God, to putting our confidence in what God has done, what He’s done for us, what He’s done in us, and what He has and will be doing through us. Then it becomes a positive term.

We do use in our English temporary usage both, mostly with a negative term. So I think exalt does bring out the positive, and it’s also a totally legitimate translation of the term. Most of the translations, the 30-something translations that we consult at a point like this—and I did look through—are about evenly split between exalt and rejoice.

So anyway, I’ve repented. I’ve changed my mind and changed the translation to match. Thank you.

As you’ve mentioned, the third boast is in the Lord Himself in chapter 5, verse 11. Last time we were here, we ended up skipping verses six through ten. The Lord has encouraged me so much through this, so I just wanted to share quickly before we jump into the three steps in the text as well.

So just reading:

**"For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.
But God demonstrates His own love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
Much more, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.
For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.
And not only this, but we also boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation."** And so where we start is at the end of the downward spiral, in a place where we are totally helpless. That word for ungodly actually refers to those who are walling the Lord out and are arrayed against Him and against the knowledge of Him. While we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for those in opposition to Him.

Then there's this kind of thought experiment crescendo: one will hardly die for a righteous man, someone who is law-abiding, who does the right thing generally. Righteous—it's someone who is respected.

And then there's a contrast. It intensifies to the good man. So not only does this person generally do the right thing as well, respected, but the impact is good. Perhaps for the good man, someone would dare to die.

But how often does that actually happen?

And then it says, but God demonstrates His own love toward us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

For the longest time, I really dwelled at that verse and focused there. It's a wonderful meditation and worship. But then one time when I was reading this a couple of years ago, I was just struck by the very next verse, and in particular, two words: much more.

So what could be much more than Christ dying for sinners at the right time? It's such a strong encouragement. If the Lord loves sinners to the degree that He would die for them, what's His commitment for His friends, for those who have His life?

"Much more, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him."

That word wrath we also recognize from Romans 1. The wrath of God is the consequences of those three exchanges, and the Lord is declaring here, with the same terms, that wrath we are going to be rescued from. He's totally committed. We see His commitment level toward His enemies; we see that in the cross. And this is for the ones who are His total commitment.

"And if while we were enemies we were reconciled, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."

I think as we go through any sanctification process, we know that it's not easy. There are setbacks. There are failures, especially in repeat areas. Shame is a huge factor that the adversary uses to try to get us away from the Lord.

As I read these verses, there's just no reason to hide out from the Lord. If I want to grow in the Lord, and grow out of the old, the way to do it is to draw closer to Him, not to hide because of shame. These verses are such an encouragement to get going on those three steps. We talked about last time, this upward spiral is the hope for embarking on these three steps in general.

I just wanted to add that in there because it's been such an encouragement. So now we get to look at the resource that we get from the Lord to begin taking the step, the mechanics of the step and the fruit. For step one, the starting point that the Lord gives us is in Romans 5:12-21. And again, we won't go through the whole thing now, but what I'd like to bring out in the summary is just the last two verses. **"The law came in that the transgression might increase, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more. That as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."**

Before we came to the Lord, sin reigned. Sin had sovereign control and dictated what we must do. That sovereign reign dictates what decisions are allowed to live and what decisions must die.

After we come to the Lord, the most amazing news: grace reigns in our life. We have His grace, we have His favor, and we have freedom to obey, as well as freedom to keep on doing the old. He has given us His life and is wooing us to learn to trust Him more and more and to walk and live in the new.

This is the resource we start with. As grace reigns, it is through righteousness, through our relationship with the Lord, which we have by faith. It is unto eternal life. The hope is built in here: we get to know Him, Father and Son, intimately as we go through this process.

And so that's our starting point. Grace reigns because of the righteousness we have in Jesus.

And so then the first step, the mechanics of it, (and we'll jump very fast here) is in Romans 6:12-13: **"Do not let sin reign in your mortal body that you should obey its lusts.** Don't let sin reign so that you obey its demands, what it compels you to do, what your old goal was. It has certain demands on what it takes to achieve the goal. Don't let sin reign in your mortal body. **And do not go on presenting the members of your body as weapons of unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those alive from the dead and your members as weapons of righteousness to God."**

Steve mentioned that dimension one is the element of warfare. What we decide and what our objective is, is part of the grand warfare of the Lord—righteousness, abundant life—and the adversary, which is self-focused, not thankful for the way the Lord set things up, and wanting to elevate oneself to the position of God.

It is this choice in prayer to come before the Lord and to pray the Gethsemane prayer: "Not my will but yours be done." I am exchanging my objective in practice and in prayer to the Lord for what He has called me to instead.

So that's the mechanics of step one. And the result in the next verse: **"Sin shall not be master over you."** That is the fruit. That's the hope then for step two—that the result of step one is freedom from the compulsive drive of sin, and then we have hope of being able to take step two successfully. The fact that we are free from the compulsion means we are free to take step two. We have the hope. And that's really key. Change needs to be proactive.

As we get to step two, and as we look at each step and specific examples of issues we're familiar with and see how this applies, it all needs to be approached proactively.

Some people want to take step one: one and done, and they wonder why their lives don't change when they go to God and say, "Okay, I'm not going to get angry anymore." They pray about it and say, "Lord, I recognize that getting angry does not accomplish Your purposes. It doesn't make things better. It makes things worse. And so I'm not going to do it anymore."

That's a legitimate way of doing step one (sort of. Often the root of anger is an idol behind the surface). Then they wonder why they keep getting angry. "Well, I prayed about it. Because I prayed about it, God's not answering my prayer. Or prayer doesn't work. Or I don't know what. So I guess it doesn't work."

How many storerooms, junk piles, whatever, in people's houses have guitars, hopefully cheap beginner guitars, not expensive ones, though I'm sure there are some, that were purchased either by or more likely for some budding teenager who wants to get up on a stage somewhere with his prop and have people worship him? He thinks just getting a guitar is going to do it. After finally badgering his parents, finally getting a guitar for Christmas or his birthday, he thinks that's all there is to it. He doesn't do anything. He doesn't take lessons. He doesn't practice. He takes it and kind of fiddles with the strings and pretends he's singing some popular song with thousands of teenage girls swooning in the audience.

But he discovers that it takes a lot of effort over an extended period of time to become someone who can stand up with a guitar and make noise with it that people like and have people appreciate. That's the way it is for a lot of people in the way they approach trying to deal with sin in their lives. They may actually deal with stuff and find, "Yeah, I'm free from the compulsion, but I still keep doing it."

You can take any one of the steps. The step that's easiest to take is actually step two. We get into it. Because step two is about doing. People who don't factor God into their lives, they spend their lives doing. Why? Because "Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness. Let them rule." Do things. Manage things.

"Rule" doesn't really connect with us that much because we think of monarchies and that sort of stuff. But manage—yes. Manage the affairs of life. Do things. Do useful things. They may be useful for accomplishing what in itself is not useful, but they are a useful way to try to make that happen. Life is all about doing. The simplest thing about life is it's all about doing. We spend our lives doing. Genuine believers—not just people who come in because they found Christians are nice people to be around but aren't letting it affect their lives yet. They're just enjoying the contact high experience, which is legitimate as you're being drawn in as long as it doesn't stagnate at that point.

Another common issue is people just trying to do (step 2) and they find they can't because they're compelled to keep doing the old. That's because they haven't taken step one. They haven't changed their purpose and their objectives.

With step two and the musician analogy, I really like that. It's really helpful. Step one is committing to playing piano, violin, or whatever instrument it is. Step two is determining what is it going to take to actually be able to meet the objective. It's going to take a lot of practice. It's going to be a sustained effort, instance by instance. As you're practicing, you're improving.

Step three, in the case of learning to be a musician, is when you meet a really good musician and the instrument becomes an extension of who they are. And they're able to express something beyond just the technical elements that you're focusing on during the practice sessions. Their expression through the music enters a new level beyond that.

I find that a helpful picture as we look at these three steps.

For step two, the mechanics of how to take a step, I love the story about the two cowboys in the honky tonk saloon. The pioneer man is making the pioneer box just rock. One cowboy turns to the other and says, "Can you play the pioneer like that?" The other replies, "I don't know. I never tried." That's all it takes.

For the mechanics of step two, it's described primarily in verse 19 of chapter six. **"For just as you presented your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness resulting in further lawlessness, so now present yourselves, present your members as servants to righteousness resulting in sanctification."**

The question here is, now that I've changed allegiance, what are the choices I make in the moment-by-moment decisions? What am I furthering as a result of those choices? And where it goes after that is actually reminding us of where our moment-by-moment  decisions lead. And so in verse 21, **what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you're now ashamed? The outcome of those things is death. But now having been freed from sin and bound to service to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification and the outcome, eternal life.**

**"For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."** As we're learning and discovering what it takes to live out our new commitment on a moment-by-moment basis or an opportunity-by-opportunity basis, we're doing something that's not familiar to us. Again, the music learning example: no one comes out of the womb being a concert pianist. That's not a situation anyone's been in. You need to recognize what it's going to take.

We've used anger as a common example tonight. To change the way that I interact with others when things are not going exactly how I planned, we're trying something that's not familiar to us to date. Because it's not familiar, it's so easy to get focused on, "I'm following this rule. And why this rule? I'm under grace. I'm free to choose!"

What it's saying here is that it's infinitely better, even if we were slaves to the rules, it's infinitely better to be a slave or a servant to the Lord and the rules that result in life versus to serve and to labor for sin, and those things that still demand a lot of us.

For anger, anger requires a lot of energy and it costs a lot of capital, social capital with the people around us. It is expensive to be angry. Does it make sense to pay that cost for all the death that will result on the other end?

Romans 6:23 says, **"The wages** [that you worked hard for and that you expended so much for] **of sin is death."** It's a negative paycheck. You worked really hard and they withdrew money from your bank account. **"But the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord,"** is getting to know Him as we trust Him on a moment-by-moment basis.

Even if at the moment our focus is just on, "Lord, I really need to learn how to just do this the new way, in a way that's not familiar to me. Show me the mechanics of this." That is challenging, but it's infinitely better than what we were serving before.

It's so easy to think, "I'm a free agent. I'm not serving anyone. I'm not serving anything." That's not what Scripture says... It's just not the reality. We are always serving an objective, either the Lord and His purpose or something that's self-centered and that actually doesn't lead to life. It is one or the other.

The benefit of step two is recognizing the free gift of the Lord versus the wages of sin.

After that, in Romans 7, Paul goes into a long analysis of the problem of law. It's not because law is an issue, but because of our flesh that is reacting against law. And where we go in Romans 8, which is the hope for taking step three, is we don't have to live by the flesh, which reacts against the law, but we get to live by the Spirit. The focus of the Spirit isn't, am I following the rules perfectly? The focus of the Spirit is getting to please our heavenly Father and walk with Jesus and to please our Lord Jesus.

It frees us from the "I'm doing things that aren't familiar to me, that feel laborious, that feel like they take a lot of energy", to the relationship of, "Lord, you've given me your life, and I want to know you more. I want to join you. I want to serve you. I want to walk with you."

The joy and the delight of that relationship with Him really makes a lot of the unfamiliarity and the effort that it takes pale in comparison. We see that in Romans 8 as well.

So Romans 8 is long, and the hope section in the third step is the longest of the three. The one little section I wanted to bring out for tonight was Romans 8:10.

It says, **"If Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. If the Spirit of Him who raised Christ Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you."**

The resource that we're given and the hope that we're given to take step three and to go beyond the big challenge of step two, which is the flesh and its reaction against law, is that we're given new life.

The body apart from the Spirit is unable to please God, because of the corruption of the flesh. But the Lord has given us His life that empowers us to move beyond just that reaction factor and to say, "Lord, I have your life and I'm going to grow up to be like you and to be like Jesus and, you know, getting to please you as my purpose and as my motivation, getting to express you."

The joy gives so much strength and motivation to continue living in the new.

We will go into this in a lot more detail in later weeks. To jump to the mechanics of the third step, it jumps into Romans 12, and we'll talk about why probably in a later week as well. Romans 12:1 says,

**"I urge you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies, a living and holy sacrifice, pleasing to God, which is your logical service of worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is: that which is good and well-pleasing and perfect."**

The third step is presenting our bodies, which at the end of step one, we're obeying from the heart, from our motivation, from our objective.

At the end of step two—and we didn't look at this tonight, but we will get there—we're obeying in our mind. We understand what it takes and are committed to doing it. But there's a barrier of the flesh. The flesh is rebelling against what our mind says, has also decided and understands needs to be done in order to achieve the objective.

And finally, at the end, in step three, we're presenting our bodies to the Lord.

Our mind obeyed. We were obeying with our mind, but our body wasn't fully under our direction.

In step three here, our body is now presented fully to the Lord, unto His service, because we're living by the new life.

And that's our basis for how we process information, how we live.

Step three, exactly the same pattern as we saw in Genesis. The first three days, the third day has two parts. Second three days, the third day has two parts.

In each of those cases, the first part is the third development, which completes the development. And then that second part is the ongoing state that the three developments prepare completely for.

And then it just goes on indefinitely. It's propagation. Initially propagation, edible plant life, preparation for the animals, and then propagation of man's rule, man's management, man's care of the living beings.

We see the same thing here. The third step, the first part is our relation to God, where we are now relating to God as mature believers, as our Heavenly Father.

We are managing the inheritance He has given us, which is new life in Christ. We are managing it because of our relationship with Him. We manage it because we want to be pleasing to Him.

It's not about obedience. It's about pleasing.

Jesus several times, at least once—I think it's several times in John's gospel—says, "I always do what is pleasing to my Father."

We enter into living life on that basis. Mature sons of God, heirs of eternal life, heirs of the kingdom. We are reigning in life with Jesus.

The second part of step three is here in the beginning of Romans 12, which introduces the rest of Romans, which is all about living out sacrificial servant love in all the arenas of life.

It's again the same two parts, but Romans 12 introduces the second part, the completion of step three, which is its application to life from then on.

Once we enter into it, this is life the way it should be, the way God intends, going forward indefinitely and propagating that through sharing it with others and guiding them in pertaining to the same level of maturity and alliance with God.

We will come back to this as we go through specifically and as we do it with concrete familiar examples.

Some of the examples will be everyday examples that virtually everybody addresses. Some of them will be more difficult examples that we may have chances to help people with, but may not be our issue.

It is very helpful to understand and be able to help people. The fruit at the end of the third step is that we're joined with the Lord. We are joining Him to bring His life and to bring the kingdom of heaven down to earth.

It's not a defensive posture. We're on the offensive with the Lord to bring the kingdom of heaven down.

The result is that we're not going to be conformed to this age or to this world. We're not going to let the world squeeze us into its mold, but we're actually joining the Lord to bring the way the Lord does things and His life down to earth and to bring life, to be transformed by the renewing of our mind that we may prove, to demonstrate what the Lord is here to do, what the will of God is, "that which is good in its effect."

It's not just an intention now, but in its effect, "that's well-pleasing and that's mature or perfect."

The plane at which we now get to join the Lord is so much higher than if we didn't have to go through this process.

It is so worth it. It is a real glimpse of the joy of heaven.

Of course, it is eternal life. It is wonderful that we get a clearer picture of how to enter into it now, today.

We can be a part of the Lord's creating, bringing heaven to earth and expressing Him to others.

Let's pray.

> Oh Lord, thank you that we get to live life with You, that you don't just throw out a bunch of rules and say, go do it. Thank You that You're a God of love, a God of relationship, and also that You don't just do it to us.

> We often think that we would love that, to just pray and You zap us and then we're perfect. But thank You that You give us the dignity of working this out with You.

> As Paul says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is at work in you, both to will and to work for His good pleasure."

> Thank You that we do all of this with You, changing the goal, changing what we're living for, striving for, changing that to join You, and then proactively, how do we live this out by the power of Your Spirit.

> Thank You that our impact is first. Our goal is to please You.

> Thank You that we can do that in our practical lives. It's pretty amazing that we can bless You and please You. Thank you that we get to bring heaven to earth step by step, that we get to bring Your life, Your character through us, our personality, to demonstrate, to live Your ways, the ways of the living God, that our lives would be a signpost of Your presence and make people hungry for You.

> We ask for Your power and life to do that, and thank You that You’ve given us that by the Holy Spirit. Lead us in walking that out in practice so that the people right around us see You and that we get to please You each day as well as be part of Your work in the life of others.

> Thank You Lord God, in Your name, amen.

Just a little addendum. As Erica said, God doesn’t just give us a whole bunch of rules and say, go do it. He gives us a whole bunch of opportunities and says, go do it.

Opportunities to bring Him to those around us.

To experience and participate in His life.

And then share with others.
