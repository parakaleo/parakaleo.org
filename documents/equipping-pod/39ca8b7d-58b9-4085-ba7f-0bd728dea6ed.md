> Lord Jesus, thank You so much for Your tremendous love that goes far, far, far beyond all we can ask or think for each one of us. And thank You for Your covenant love, that You have committed Yourself to us, as we have given ourselves to You, responded to Your call of love. Thank You that You complete what You begin.
>
> And Lord, all of us have grown a lot in Your character, Your beautiful character that You've placed at the heart of each of us by Your Holy Spirit: all who have welcomed Your invitation and asked you to take over. Lord, we're thankful to be Your people in a crazy broken world that has always been that way, including elements in us. And thank You that You give us victory over the flesh and that we get to learn to walk in Your Spirit more and more.
>
> Lord, thank You for the rich passages that we have been in in each of these weeks and last week with Hebrews 3 and 4 and Psalm 95. And thank You that we get to continue that now and really pull it all together. And Lord, we ask that we will not be like the generation that fell in the wilderness because of hardness of heart. Lord, may we cultivate soft hearts to hear You in the midst of all the challenges of life.
>
> And thank You for the invitation to rest deeply in You while we are so active in Your service. We ask for that for each one of us. Open our ears to hear You, our hearts to respond. Highlight for each of us the truths that are especially for us, but may we listen intently for others too, that we may encourage them and one another.
>
> Thank You, Lord, in Your name. Amen.

As you remember, we are in Hebrews 3 and 4. We spent a lot of time in Psalm 95, the second half of which is quoted in Hebrews 3. We were focusing especially on **"Today, if you would hear his voice, do not harden your hearts,"** as the generation that fell in the wilderness.

And we looked at the issues that cause us to become deaf to the Lord and what can we do to soften our hearts to stay open and eagerly responsive to His voice, to hear it. The Psalm finishes talking about the rest that He invites every one of us into.

Tonight, we will do some review but especially focus in on what exactly is that rest? It has been an invitation from the Lord since the beginning, since the end of Genesis 1 and into Genesis 2. What is it? How can we cultivate it? What blocks it?

I made myself a two-column list to go through these passages. This would probably be on your own afterwards as you review the passage:
1. what things enable us to hear the Lord, to be responsive to Him, to enter into His rest?
2. And what blocks us from it?

And there's a lot of specifics in this passage if you look from Hebrews 2:14 all the way through the end of chapter 4. So that's a little encouragement homework for each of us that should be very practical and very helpful.

As we looked a couple of weeks ago at 1 Corinthians 10, we saw three categories of things that block us from entering into the rest. And we looked at it in various ways. It all goes back to the Israelites in the wilderness and not entering into the promised land.

And to get those three down in principle, the first one is things that we have already internalized as necessities or totally unacceptable. Things that we have concluded that we must have and things that we've concluded that we must not permit or be subject to.

It is first those things that we've already internalized that make it a no-brainer. When God speaks to us, we don't hear it, don't respond to it, because our mind is already made up. All the influences that have come down to us, family, social, everything that we internalized from our society, culture, so forth.

The second is the influences from people around us who are convinced that life requires having certain things and avoiding other things at all costs.

The third is looking at what is happening to us and saying, "I don't like this! God, this isn't what I signed up for." Meaning this isn't what I thought I was signing up for.

Those three categories are the things that block us from hearing what God is saying. Because we always evaluate everything according to the standards that we have already internalized. This is every aspect of life. It does not just have to do with interacting with God and responding to Him or not.

We can't consider everything that comes up in its totality every time something comes up. We'd never get as far as even eating breakfast in the morning if we had to do that, so we've already decided about many things. Those are the things: the things we've already decided are givens pro and con, things that people around us are convinced of and pushing pro and con.

Because we're immersed in that, it doesn't seem like we're making any decision. We're just going with the flow. I like to think of it as being in one of those 70-75 mile an hour parking lots in L.A., where it's like you're parked with reference to the cars around you. But the roadway is going by under you at 120 feet a second. You're not conscious really of where you go, where we're going. We're just all going where the freeway goes. And we decided that that's where we want to go. And then there's the, "wait a minute. God, this isn't what I expected". And I don't know about this. I know about You. I want You. But I'm not sure I want this that's coming along with You. And so are You really in charge? Are You really loving? Do You care? Are You there? Are You on Your cell phone? Are You watching TV? What are You doing?

Those are the things that compete with what God is saying to us from His word and by His Spirit and cause us to background, to tune out, ignore, or just react against and turn away from what God is saying.

The warning from Hebrews 3:12 is "take care, brethren, lest there should be in any one of you an evil unbelieving heart in falling away from the living God."** Unbelieving heart, unpersuaded to trust God, unpersuaded to trust His word. That's what this is.

Over time we come to trust God. We start out trusting for specific things that we already think are wonderful, that He promises. And then over time, we begin to taste some things that's not quite what we expected, but find out, "hey, this is really good. And I really didn't need something that I thought I did".

Progressively, we shift our focus, our confidence from the circumstantial to the Lord Himself. And it's You who make the difference. And the ultimate is, Lord, I want Your will, whatever it is. When we do that about specific things, then we respond to His leading, we stick by that, and then we see life-filled results. A lot of times, what we're not prepared for is the process of growth that it takes to get to the life that we're looking for—the joy part of the Lord's promises.

Just like the people coming out of Egypt, they left slavery. Hooray, God delivered us! But I think they expected to enter into the promised land in about 10 days. That's about all it could have taken if they made a straight shot there. But they didn't realize the Lord wanted to take a year to take care of them, to teach them about His love, Father's love, His trustworthiness, and what it would take to walk with Him when they entered into the promised land that was full of idolatry that led to horrible practices like burning babies and all sorts of horrible sexual practices that were very destructive but very enticing.

He wanted to prepare them. But then when He said, "Okay, trust Me and let's go in," they looked at the fearful opposition and said, "Nope, we're not going there." And then they circled until that generation died off. And then those who were still there, a lot of them, because they multiplied in the desert... What else are you going to do? Well, the wilderness wanderings—why are they wandering? They're nomadic people. They've got extensive flocks and herds, and they have to be constantly finding pastures for them. I don't think the flocks and herds ate manna. And out in the desert (this is not talking about sand desert) the vegetation is sparse. And so you have to keep moving to different places.

But what they didn't expect was the process. That's often true for us. Lord, I've let go of the old things, but I don't expect the growth process that it takes because He wants to involve us with free will to respond to His goodness and walk with Him in taking charge of these areas. We want Him to just magically zap us, but that takes away our free will.

A lot of times, it's the process that has us wondering, "Lord, where are You? You're not doing what I expected. My life isn't magically better. You mean I have to work through these issues with You? I didn't expect that one." But that's where the goodness and the joy comes along the way.

As we noted last time, we're called to encourage one another day after day, as long as it's called today. Why as long as it's called today? Well, the Lord keeps presenting us with things, and the opportunity is here, and the opportunity remains to the degree that we're open. The danger is being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin because we think that something else is better. Therefore, we don't respond.

One note there with that verse 13 is that the Lord calls us to do this in community. We as Americans tend to be kind of individualistic, "Lone Ranger Christians". "I can just do this with God." And we can, but He's encouraging us that in this process, we all need to see over each other's shoulders to see the Lord.

When I'm really struggling with trusting Him for what's in front of me, whether it's dealing with my own flesh or other people's or just plain hard circumstances, it's easy to lose sight of where's the Lord. But when I am in community with other believers who can share what the Lord has done in their lives, then it helps me to see what He is available and eager to do in my life as well.

It's actually an important word, that verse 13, that we're called to encourage one another and not just, and especially when things are hard, it's easy to isolate. So it's very important. It doesn't mean share with the whole church, but find one or two or a small group of other believers where you're all trusting the Lord to keep growing in the Lord. You can keep encouraging each other, praying for each other, sharing God's stories of what He's just done. Then we're encouraging one another in what He loves to do and will do, even though we haven't seen Him yet in this part of our lives. We did mention the parable of the wedding guests. They're invited. "Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah". And then when the time comes to enjoy the blessing... "oh well, I've got something else..."

Students on campus today, if you look at their engagement calendar, you'll find every time slot has two or three things they've committed themselves to, knowing that they can't do all of them.

They talk about, "I'm down for it." Used to be,"I'm up for it." "I'm excited about this," but now it's "down for it." I guess meaning "put me down," which is odd because "down for it" has the idea, "sign me up, I'm committed," but they are less committed than the generation that talked about being "up for" something.

And what they mean is, well, when the time comes, I'll decide then. And that's the danger. We don't commit ourselves ahead. And so, the Holy Spirit can't possibly show me ahead.

Years ago, we were registered for an all-weekend, all-campus-wide Christian conference. It was terrible trying to get students to sign up because they couldn't decide ahead—they had to leave room for the Holy Spirit. Well, I seem to think that the Holy Spirit can't plan ahead, and the Holy Spirit can't honor the needs of the people at the conference center to order food and all that, knowing how many are coming.

The issue at the end of chapter three is that it's the ones who do not enter God's rest who are the ones who are disobedient, which is a legitimate translation. But the problem is, what do we mean by disobedient?

Disobedient to us means disobedient in practice. Earlier, that term was used for disobedient in practice. But right now, this is disobedient because of not being persuaded to obey. And that's the big danger.

And so then the calling : **"Let us fear lest, while a promise remains of entering his rest"**...

It's not that God is going to pull the plug on the offer. It's that we are pulling the plug on the offer because we become callous.

Callouses are built up by irritation. The body builds up a resistance. Callous skin is insensitive. And so I don't want to be bothered by that anymore. Either I don't want to do anything about it or I can't do anything about it. So stop bugging me.

**"Let us fear lest, while a promise remains of entering his rest."**...

And the interesting thing is that Jesus has come to rescue those who, through fear of death, were subject to slavery all their lives. (Hebrews 2:14)

It's FOMO, fear of missing out. But what we should be afraid of missing out on is not missing out on supposed "life" because we don't take up all the opportunities to do what God warns us against... warning us that that may look like life, but it isn't life. We're not to be afraid of God, but we're to take seriously the warning that the promise remains as long as we're not hardened against it to the point where we don't hear it anymore.

We should put in a note here: this isn't to say, "Oh no, I may not be saved," because a lot of people flip out with this.

Hebrews is written to people where Paul's not sure where they really are. They are Hebrew. They came from a Hebrew background. He references a lot of Old Testament scripture, what we call Old Testament. But it's not clear whether they are actually trusting the Lord and moving forward with Him, or just trying to add Jesus as one more guarantee of God's faithfulness, but still completely going back to the law. "I've got to earn it to be sure."

It is addressed to believers and unbelievers, because I can, as Steve was saying, progressively get more and more dead to the Lord if I just want Him to do what I'm asking Him to do instead of going to Him to join Him in His calling. So that I can do what He wants me to do is where real fulfillment would come.

The point here is I want to be cultivating hearing the Lord and joining Him because as I do, I will enter that rest. I will rest more and more in His leading, His provisions, His calling, and joining Him rather than just trying to get Him to bless my ideas.

> Steve, when you said, or Erica, the ones who do not enter God's rest are the ones who are disobedient because of not being persuaded to obey. I didn't understand the distinction you were trying to make.

> You are distinguishing between different types of disobedience.

Yes.

There's disobedience in practice, and there's disobedience from the heart, that I'm not persuaded to obey. Now, the two are not unrelated, but the one is a focus. It's what the words focus our attention on. What I do either focuses our attention on what we didn't do that we should have done, or what are they focused on—the fact that we didn't. We didn't regard the calling to obey as anything of any significance for us.

The issue is the one, and I'm going to have to make this really quick. The one focuses on the action that results from not being persuaded. The one is my response to the calling. The other is my action that follows from that. The disobedience in practice leads to punishment. It leads to bad consequences, whether those are imposed or whether those are built in. You smash your thumb with a hammer, it hurts. That's built into the mechanics, the physical, physiological mechanics of life. But you tell me what to do, I don't do it. Now the issue is an interpersonal issue.

We are not talking about what we do or don't do. It's our relationship with God who is calling us to do something or not do something. And so **"today, if you hear His voice"**, the emphasis is on how do I respond to input from the Lord? Do I welcome it? Do I ignore it? Do I fight it? Do I tune it out because I'm more interested in other things anyway?

**Therefore, let us fear lest while the promise remains of entering His rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it. We've had good news preached to us just as they also, but the word they heard did not profit them because it was not united by faith in those who heard.**

**The word they heard did not profit them, did not benefit them because it was not bided by faith in those who heard**:
Those who heard didn't trust that there was any benefit in it. So they ignored it. And for we who are believing, we who are trusting. This is a participle. This is not talking about the past. This shows up constantly in our translations and leads people to think, "Well, I believed, I became a Christian." Yeah, I did. But that's not what it's talking about. It's talking about lifestyle. It talks about we who are trusting God in practice here and now enter that rest. As I trust God, I am resting in Him. And that's what it is to rest in Him.

**"As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest... although His works were finished from the foundation of the world."**

Now we get an insight into what God's rest is. **For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day "and God rested on the seventh day from all His works", and again, in this passage, "They shall not enter My rest."** So let's go back to that. God rested on the seventh day from all His works. Why? They were finished. What were His works up to that point? It was preparing the world for us to rule it, to manage it.

As we've noted, not to manage the forces of nature, but to manage the realm of living beings, to manage the animals, and particularly it's referenced the animals at that point. We don't have human society yet. And it's that too. It's to manage it. We're to manage it cooperatively, the way the members of the Godhead cooperate in their alliance as one, as the Lord God.

As sin entered, human cooperation and harmonious alliance is broken up. He created us in His image. He created us to be living representations of Him through whom He could communicate His nature and His will for us in terms that we could comprehend, fellow human beings.

He commissioned us to rule, that is to manage. Our concept of rule, anything to do with authority, is very much tainted by our awareness of the abuse of human authority that is widespread in a fallen world. But He is talking about managing things the way He does.

After all, if we are living expressions of Him and we're called to manage, then the expectation is that we will manage the way He does and He will teach us how to do that.

There is an interesting insight into seven, the number seven when it is significantly significant in Scripture. The seventh step of development is covenant. What's covenant? Covenant is voluntary free will alliance, which is distinct from a contract. A contract is based on the fear of abuse. A contract is two or more parties agreeing to fulfill certain obligations and giving the others the power to enforce or punish violations of that promise. But a covenant—and that's a covenant contract—is very much a matter of law.

Many lawyers are business lawyers, contract lawyers. It's all about that sort of stuff. There are also lawyers who deal with personal things, such as family issues. But it is law. If you don't keep the terms of the contract, then you're going to pay in some way or another.

But this is covenant. And seven is the point of covenant. It means everything is ready for the next season. At the seventh day, God rested because everything was prepared for human rule, for us to learn how to rule, to manage the affairs of life the way He does.

Seven is a point of invitation. Our invitation is to enter His rest. Our invitation is to welcome all that He has done in preparation and agree, accept the fact that everything is possible, prepared, everything is done, everything that He needs to do is done, and all we need to do now is benefit from it.

After they had happily done this for a while—we don't know how long—Adam and Eve were joyfully, happily, fulfilledly managing things, but learned to manage plants and animals and learning about functional stewardship and relational.

Then the tempter came in and said, "Hey, guys, God's holding out on you. Haven't you noticed? Haven't you noticed? He's keeping something from you. Yeah, you can eat from every tree in the garden except, except, except. Don't you see? He's given you all this stuff, but then He's slipped in a Mickey and He's out to get you. So don't trust in it."

**"They shall not enter my rest"** means because they are not willing to trust Me and are not willing to trust that I have set it all up right and everything is in place for them to benefit. They think they have to correct Me.

And so now we come back to the current application: since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience, because they are not persuaded to enter into trusting God that He has set things up right.

**He again fixes a certain day today, saying through David, "After so long a time, just as it has been said before, today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."** And so what he's pointing out is Joshua invited them, led them into the land. But David is bringing this up because there's still a rest for the people of God that they've not entered into that is the invitation to each of us. And that's his point. So that's where he's going.

The promised land was all prepared for them to go in and take charge, and that included why they spent 430 years in Egypt. The Lord says because the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete. He was not going to evict the people who were living there until they were so ungodly that it was hopeless.

And of course, that doesn't mean that there weren't individuals who were exceptions. God demonstrates that throughout history. He acts on a large scale group basis, but he honors individual exceptions. There are people like Rahab the harlot in Jericho and other people. There's always the exception here and there.

And so God doesn't trash everybody because most people are ungodly. But the point is the reason that they didn't benefit from all that God had prepared for them and promised to them was because they were not convinced to trust God—that what He was doing, that what He was providing, that what He was calling them into was actually good.

He again fixed a certain date today, saying through David, after so long a time, David lived long after Joshua. Just as was said before, "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."

If Joshua had given them rest, he did give them possession of the physical promised land. And so that's the second stage in God's teaching us about rule.

Initially, the human race was charged with ruling the earth, being in charge of the animals especially and so forth. Then with Israel, it's a specific society in a specific geopolitical territory, and they are learning to rule that. So it now moves to the level of human society and human property management, etc.

Hebrews 3:10 **"The one who's entered that rest, has himself also rested from his works as God did from His."** That I don't need to keep trying to improve things, fix things, but I get to rest in all the preparation that God has done for my rule.

That is over the presence and opposition of sin in the body in which I live. It's learning to rule over the physical body that is given to me. I live in it. And as a new creature in Christ, indwelt by the Holy Spirit, I am committed to doing God's will.

But there is also in me, Romans 7, Paul says, **"I find in myself, that in myself, the one who wills to do good, who wills to do God's will, opposition, sin is present here."** There's a force in me that fights against it. This is the dominion that the Lord's giving us now to manage the opposition within our own bodies, to take charge of our bodies and use them to glorify God instead of using them for selfish, ungodly, hurtful purposes. And we've looked at it and we will again later, but not tonight.

Taking charge of my thoughts, my attitudes, because it's what I'm cultivating in my thinking and my attitudes that will come out through my words and actions. We kid ourselves in thinking I can carry on this internal life and never show it. Everybody who lives near me can read very well what's going on, which is wonderful because the Lord calls us to be people of integrity where what is on the inside is also on the outside. It's consistency that I take charge of the flesh where my thinking is roaring and take charge of it with the Lord rather than coddling it and letting it grow with anger, complaint, grumbling—all of that—and instead take charge of it.

"Lord, thank you for this. I don't know what to do yet about it, but thank you that you're here. I entrust it to you. Show me how to participate in what you want to do and do it your way."

I get to take charge of the flesh, which grumbles and yells and tries to force what I think needs to happen instead, or feel sorry for myself instead of thanking the Lord. "Thank you that you're here. You see everything that's going on. You see what's going on with the people and the circumstances and me."

Show me from Your word, which is where we're going, how do I serve You in this situation rather than make what I think needs to happen happen, which we tend to go on a crusade to do.

**"So let's therefore be diligent to enter that rest."** That is to trust in what God has prepared for us and not be trying to judge it and find fault with it and improve on it, supposedly. How do you improve on what's perfect? You can alter what's perfect, but it will not be improvement.

**Lest anyone fall through the same example of disobedience**: lest we refuse to trust God because of things that are already given to us, because of finding ways of people who are not trusting God around us attractive, or because of looking at what God is doing or not doing.

"I have physical illness. I prayed to God to heal me. He hasn't done it. So God's no good." God hasn't promised to heal all physical illness. It's very interesting. People want to rely on the promise, "I'll put none of the diseases on you that I put on Egypt." But you have to read the statement. It's a conditional statement. "If you will trust me," and I'm not quoting it exactly, "but if you will follow me exactly, then you won't be getting these things." That third category really is: I don't trust God because He's not doing my will. I don't trust God because it's contrary to the givens that I've already committed to. I don't trust God because that way I won't have the goodies that unbelievers around me think are wonderful. I won't trust God because He's not doing my will. Those are the three blocks.

One that all of us easily get caught up in is, Lord, I don't agree with Your free will priority. I do for me, but not for them. I want to have the free will and I will fight for it. But I don't want the people of my life to have total free will. I want them to do what I think they should do instead of, thank You, Lord.

Free will is part of Your gift to human beings for good and for evil. And thank You that You make it clear we've not used it well. But thank You that I get to use my free will to join with You to be redemptive in maybe a very hard situation. There is one person I can do something about, and that is me. And so I can go to... But only with God's working with me. There's a lot about me that I can't do anything about apart from God.

All of entering into God's promises takes trust in Him. You see this coming up again and again, the disobedience because of not being persuaded to trust. And it's that we are trusting. We are the people who trust and are learning to trust. The more we do, the more we enter into His dynamic rest.

They could not have taken the land if they weren't trusting God. The opposition was way bigger than they were. But the Lord taught them over and over: as you trust Me, as you follow what I call you to do, then the battle belongs to the Lord. I get to participate, but it is not my strength that is going to make the day. And I'm going with you in redemptive action here.

And just a little note: the Lord did warn them. He held them out for 430 years until the iniquity of the Amorite was complete, till there was nothing more the Lord could say or do to show His goodness to turn their hearts.

But as Steve said, there's always a back sort of those who did. The iniquity is that their hearts were irrevocably hardened against the true God. They were contagious to everybody who came close. But the Lord warned His people, if you do the same thing, you too will be evicted. It isn't because you're extra special. But rather, this is the type of people, people who trust Me, who learn to live life in a way that's redemptive and will bless your neighbors as well as yourself following My direction.

That's the type of people that I'm looking for, but it takes trust to do that because it's often not what we would come up with. We're working hard to make life happen, but without trusting Him for the, without going through the process of growth in our own lives. We just want You to make it happen, especially in them. And the Lord said, "I didn't choose you because you were better or because you were more numerous. I chose you because you're a stiff-necked people". You are people who do not like to be told what to do or not do. And I needed an example.

Paul makes himself an example of the same order individually, that God could demonstrate in me, chiefest among sinners, that the good news that God wants to show people is there is no one that My love cannot reach. But He doesn't force it on them.

So God is calling people, calling us to trust. Although "they saw My works for 40 years", He kept demonstrating His faithfulness to them to meet whatever needs they had. He keeps doing it. He loves to take impossible-looking people. He does that always. He does that now.

We are all encouraged when we hear the testimonies of people who, if we had known them before they came to the Lord, we would have said absolutely impossible, hopeless, helpless. Then their testimony says, "Yeah, but then all it took was my trusting the Lord."

The opposition of the world is greater than I am.
And God intends it to be that way.
But He is greater than that opposition.

And so, the only way I can defeat that opposition is by trusting Him.

In Joshua 1:5:
**"No one will succeed in opposing you because I am with you."**

I go into a situation and I can face somebody who I couldn't possibly oppose successfully just on my own strength, but God can. That means that I have to be trusting Him. I can't, You can, therefore We can.

The issue is being not persuaded to trust God, that He really is determined to bless us, to set us free from the things that have enslaved us—those who, through fear of death, were held in the grip of sin all their lives. And God sets us free from that.

We're often in over our heads. The opposition in the land was enormous, and it's true even in the wilderness—one situation after another: no water, no food, and we're being attacked by the Amalekites. There are times when it feels like that in our lives, when it's one big thing after another.

We have had quite a few seasons like that over our lifetime. It's easy to lose sight of the living God and just be trying to figure out desperately, what can I do?

Instead of backing off to:
What have I seen the Lord do?
What have I seen of His goodness?

They saw My works for 40 years.
Where have I seen God's goodness? What have I seen of His working in impossible situations?

That's where to go at times when we're overwhelmed with the current situation. We've usually tried everything we could think of before doing this. Much better to start with this: to back off and say, "Lord, this is bigger than I am."

It wasn't what I thought would happen, but here it is. Thank You for it. And now, where have I seen you in the past when it was overwhelming, when it was scary, when other people were choosing things that were just the opposite of what I longed and prayed for them to do?

And yet here we are. Thank you, Lord. This is bigger than I am. Where have I seen you at work in the past?

That's where we need one another, where I may be so overwhelmed at the moment by the challenge of what I'm dealing with that I need to hear of God's faithfulness through other people over their shoulders.

Also, that's the value of Scripture, especially narrative passages where I can, like in Second Chronicles, like Genesis, see a whole life and the choices they make and how God works.

That can really build our trust, because we see, "What do you do, Lord, with a Jacob who isn't trusting you, is constantly trying to do the foxhole prayers and the bargaining to get you to do what he wants?"

You work with him over time. You show your grace and your work in very amazing ways, almost in spite of him. That gives us hope for us.

But in Abraham, and we're the seed of Abraham, those who are learning to trust him, to go back to: what have I seen of you? What have others seen of you? How do you work when people do trust you to do things your way? You do amazing things.

We see that looking at whole lives in Scripture—good kings in Judah, bad kings in Judah in Second Chronicles. I love that because you see the whole life, you see the choices, you see what God does, and see the occasional visits of the prophet to encourage more trust instead of, "You did what you did. You got afraid and you gave all the gold and silver from the temple to try to buy him off."

And He's still here for more. So it's instead, "Come to me and do it my way."

Those are all what to do to back off. If I'm going to trust, I need to look at God and His trustworthiness. You can't just will to trust. "Oh, just trust God." How much good does that do you?

It's looking at His faithfulness over time in the lives of others if I'm in too close to what's happening in my life at the moment where I don't know how this is going to play out yet. But I can look at how things played out for those who trusted You to do things Your way.

I have done that in the past and You've been at work. So I can trust You. I choose to trust You for this one. How do we handle this one, Lord? What do You say in Your word?

Then trust Him to walk it and see. Then you're giving Him a powerful tool to work in a bad situation.

The danger, of course, is not trusting Him.

**They saw my works for 40 years**. "I kept showing them, showing them, showing them how trustworthy I am. But they just didn't buy it." And we've heard quite a few times of people who've said, "I grew up going to church, but I wanted to just have fun." So they took off into the party life. But before I die, I'll return to God and then I'll get to go to heaven. Well, how do you know if you're turning, not listening again and again? How do you know that you're going to return and on what basis? Is it out of trust in Him or is it just because you want the party in the sky? You want the results, but don't change me. It doesn't work that way.

We are never described in Scripture as being the descendants or the offspring of Abraham, though that's the way most of our modern translations render it. It's always the seed of Abraham, and as we've noted before, offspring, descendants is with reference to the past. But seed has its significance with reference to the future. The seed reproduces the life of that of which it's seed. We are those who propagate the life of Abraham.

What does that mean? We're not all wandering around in Bedouin tents with our flocks and herds, though Abraham did that. What is Abraham characterized by in Scripture? He's a man who trusted God, trusted God at His promises including to the point of being willing to risk his entire future on it. That's what the offering of Isaac is: "Take now your son, your only son, and offer him up."

The whole point was, it was an exercise in giving up all of his hopes in anything but the Lord. Abraham was trusting that the Lord would fulfill His promise. The Lord had promised Abraham, "Through Isaac, your seed will be named. Your future comes through Isaac. Now, give him up."

When Abraham obeyed God, he had those two things: God told me to take Isaac and go and offer him as a sacrifice. But God has promised that all of the future that He's promised me is going to happen through Isaac. So I think the evidence is there that Abraham obviously expected that Isaac would go on living after Abraham had offered him up in sacrifice—life out of death. So I think the only thing is he didn't know how God was going to do it, but he knew God would do it because he trusted God, and that made him righteous.

To be righteous is to be in a relationship with God where I trust God to be God. He trusts me to be a godly human being. And it's through that relationship that I am able to fulfill God's loving blessings of intent for me and fulfill all of that.

**Lest anyone fall away through the same example of disobedience**, of just not being persuaded to trust in what God calls them to.

Now, how do we know "today if you hear His voice"? That's where we go now: how do I hear His voice? Hebrews 4:12 says, **"the word of God is living, active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there's no creature hidden from his sight; all things are open, laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do."**

It is through the word of God, God's communication to us, objective communication to us, that we are able to discern between what is of the spirit and what is of the flesh. What is God's working in us? And what is the new life that God is developing in us? And what is of the opposition to God that is part of this body that I live in? Which is which?

This is not talking about clear black and white, totally bright or totally dark images. It is not talking about figuring out whether the shining angel in robes and the crown and all that sort of stuff is the one I want or the one in red pajamas with a long pointed tail and a pitchfork. It is talking about where it is not obvious. How do I know where it is not obvious?

The image here, and of course, a two-edged sword—that is deadly. That was about as deadly as weaponry got at that point. It could cut coming and going. It is living. It is active. And so piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit, when he gets to the joints, we are able to judge the joints and marrow.

What are we getting at here? The implied image here is of the temple sacrifice. A sacrificial animal had to be without blemish. It is not a real offering to God if you give him the ones that you were going to call out of the flock anyway, you wanted to get rid of. No, you were to give him the first and the best. And because we trust him to provide.

But the rabbis would take a sacrificial animal, examine it, and if they could not find any blemish in it, then it would be offered in sacrifice. But then they rechecked. They did an autopsy, not to see what killed the animal, but to see whether the animal actually was without blemish. So when they examined it, if they found blemish, then it nullified the sacrifice. They had to go offer a different animal.

What is that for us? The point here is that the word of God will reveal what is hidden to natural sight. It will. The key there is the division of soul and spirit. What are we talking about? We are talking about what is from the spirit of God within and what is from the soul apart from the spirit, what Paul will term the flesh as opposed to the spirit, that which is of the natural human being who does not trust God, and what is of the spirit of God in me, which motivates, empowers, guides my new life of faith, of trusting God.

By reading God's word in a receptive manner, saying, "Show me. Show me what you promise. Show me what you call me to do. Show me where I'm on the wrong track. Show me where I've been deceived." The deceitfulness of sin being what causes us to fall away. Where have I thought I was following You, but actually I wasn't? The word is information to us on how to succeed in life. When we trust God because we know that He is determined to bless us, and not to deprive us as the tempter urged the first couple to view Him as trying to cheat us, hold out on us, keep us from the real goodies in life, we know that that's not what He is doing.

But we do know that there is a force within us that is fighting against God doing that. As we read Scripture and compare what we are doing, what we are thinking, what we are intent on with what Scripture says, then we can say, "Oh, wait a minute. This isn't what I thought it was. This won't lead to life. Lord, I trust You. And I renounce my trust in and pursuit of whatever it was. And I look for fulfillment, look for life from You instead. And from what it is that You describe here in Your word is Your will for me."

Several examples of this, because the point for us is not being disqualified, but where am I, especially where am I seeking to follow the Lord, but I'm missing? How do I know I'm missing? Well, a lot of times we feel fear. What I'm trying isn't enough. I feel depressed because I'm not getting through. There are signs of death there. That alerts me that something in my approach is not in sync with the Lord and with His calling.

Erica: It doesn't mean there aren't going to be hard times. There will be. Paul went through plenty. I'm glad I was not Mrs. Paul—beating, shipwrecks, being left for dead... He would not have been an easy character to live with. He was pretty strong in the flesh or the spirit.

Steve: That's why he didn't take a Mrs. Paul. That was God's mercy.

Erica: some examples of that I've shared with you: times of teaching, especially groups of women that I didn't know at a conference or usually at conferences. I could get so uptight ahead. And here I am, seeking to serve the Lord, I'm seeking to bless them. Why am I getting so uptight about this? I'm praying about it. I'm trusting You as best I know how. But obviously, something isn't right here.

And as you know, the Lord uses His word to divide between soul and spirit, between what is great and what isn't. What is great is I'm there to serve the Lord. I'm not just going for a walk on the beach, though that's fine. And it's very nice. I love it when we get to, but I'm here to pour out, to serve You with teaching and counseling.

But what's causing me to get uptight? I'm here trying to do my best. I want to do my best unto You, Lord, Colossians 3 style. But the point is Galatians 1:10, who am I actually seeking to please? I say I want You to be glorified and served, and I do. But I also want the kudos. I also want people to think what a great teacher I am and a great counselor because my ego really likes that. I'm a people pleaser when it comes to the flesh. I like pleasing people. I have found pretty much every time before teaching a seminar at a women's conference, I get so uptight. And it's exactly this issue. And so I know the Scriptures to go back to and trust the Lord to reapply.

I am here to glorify You. I am here because I know there are so many women who are struggling with whatever the issue is that I’m talking about—anxiety or depression or bitterness, and how to transcend that in the Lord, how to come clear. I know that I will be speaking to where people are hurting and need the truth to help them to move forward.

So what's wrong with that? It’s because I want them to think what a great teacher I am instead of their worshiping the Lord. I’d like a little of the worship myself.

I go to the Lord and I renounce doing it to have people think of me, but instead give myself to serve unto the Lord and to meet the needs of the women that He knows He is bringing, who are hurting, crying, praying, have given up, who need the truth that I have to offer. Once I’ve done that, and "Lord, I’m willing for them to think whatever they want to think about me, may they just hear You and respond to what You want to tell them". Then I am at peace and I am free to focus on delivering the message, delivering the blessing.

One time when I did that, this was with the people lined up to talk with me afterwards. It started with somebody’s mom who had come to the conference and she said, “What you need is to take Toastmasters, learn how to make speeches.” Her adult daughter was there. “Mom, be quiet. You know that's not very nice.” But I was chuckling inside. Lord, You’re saying, "do You mean it? Are You willing to look like a fool but still deliver My message?"

I thanked the lady for her good intent. We parted with a smile. And then the rest of the weekend, I was counseling people who had really been spoken to and wanted to go deeper.

The Lord sorts out a lot of times from His Word what our motivation is. I may be doing the godly thing, but I’m afraid, I'm uptight, I'm driven—all of those signs that I am not resting deeply and joyfully in Him because I’m not entrusting the process (and where it goes and how long it will take) to Him. And His calling to bring His way into bad situations, but there’s still everybody else’s free will.

Another example is anger, where I may have tried my best and things are still a mess. I’m angry about that because I can see the hurt that’s being generated by other people’s choices. It’s very easy to feel self-righteous about that. Here I am praying and nothing seems to move. And where's God in this? And the Lord has used, among many other passages, of course, Ephesians 4, that yes, do be angry in the sense that you're aware things are not the way that God wants them. It's literally in the Hebrew tremble. It's serious, but don't let it trip me into being angry again in that because I'm hurt.

And then he goes through and by the end, as he's saying, "don't give the accuser a place." Well, where am I doing it in my head of how could they do this? They know better. I raised them really well and look what they're doing. And all of those accusatory thoughts and where's God anyway, you know, I did my best and look at what they've chosen.

It's easy to start giving the accuser a base of operations in my head and coddle it because there's some reality to it. Otherwise, I'm not fabricating anything. The issues out there, they're there, but it's not my what I've tried isn't working and isn't accomplishing what I have in mind and I'm so frustrated or despairing or bitter.

Instead, he finishes that passage after saying take charge of your mind, don't give the accuser a place to work. Then it's take charge of your mouth. Then at the end, "let all bitterness, anger, clamor, slander, and etc. be put away from you. And let the peace of God dwell in your hearts. And forgive just as I have forgiven you," by the way.

By the way, I have forgiven you much. You get to release the offense factor continually of what others are doing to me. I'm the only one who's big enough to handle it. And put on a heart of compassion, kindness, and, above all sacrificial love. Then I'm giving the Lord powerful tools to work with in the lives of the other people.

It is going to take time and I don't want it to take time. I want plenty of time for my issues, but I don't want plenty of time for your issues.

The Lord's word shows me where I've, even with the best of intent, taken off on my own program of salvation, trying to fix it instead of listening to Him to track His way because He's working to change the heart.

I can use anger to try to force outward behavior change, but it tends to harden the heart and close the ears. That's James 1 being that "the anger of man cannot accomplish the righteousness of God." I can never encourage someone to trust the Lord and grow in Him through my anger.

We want it to happen fast, so we try to make it happen. But He's there to woo the heart, woo the ears open, and that takes time.

As I present myself to bring, they need to see Jesus, bring Jesus' character to them. And it's God's word that tells me the specifics of that and helps to sort out where I'm serving Him, even though I'm trying to serve Him. It sorts out what actually is service and what's actually getting in the way of His redemptive working.

And so that's another example. One last example: we have many students over the decades who graduate and then comes the question, "What am I gonna do with my life?" If you're in medical care it's pretty obvious what you're going to do, but there are many other fields where it's not, especially humanities. Well nowadays it's also hard to get jobs in tech. So it can be a time of anguish, of depression, of trying and trying and not coming up with anything. It's a hard time.

It's easy to pray and say, "Lord, I want to serve You with my gifting." It's wonderful when students do that. But then they ask, "Why am I not getting any direction?" A lot of times it's because the Lord is sorting out the motivation and the motives.

We've had students from their cultural background say, "Lord, I want to serve You. I want to do anything You want me to do." But there are caveats that are such givens, they aren't even aware of it. Of course, it's going to include a lot of money, and it's going to be prestigious, and I will have a lot of influence. Well, they "have to" do that because God says, "Honor your father and mother," and those are their values. Those are the cultural values I grew up with.

So, "Lord, I want to serve You with whatever You want." That's one to check against Scripture. How do you do that? But then there are these underground assumptions that if God's answer to "be good" has to fill all those slots and they don't hear anything, they wonder, "Where's God?"

The Lord addresses the motivation issue a lot of times. And another one that's very common now is, "Lord, You've enabled brilliant work and I've developed a lot of skills—CS, AI, all those forefront areas. And Lord, I want to serve You with that. Whatever You want." And they hear nothing.

And they do some asking, seeking, and knocking, but still can't really figure it out. A lot of times there's an underlying assumption: Of course, I'm going to do a startup company. Of course, I actually don't do very well working under anybody. So I want to use all my skills independently and make it big.

And, they may try a number of them and it just fails, it fails, it fails, which is true of a lot of startups. It's just all you hear about are the success stories, not the millions who fail until they get something that works. It's very easy to be so discouraged. Where is God in this?

Instead of looking to, "What's my motivation? What does Scripture say about my motivation? Have I learned to work peacefully under authority, even though it's not perfect?" That's part of most jobs. But the flesh is allergic to authority—even to me telling me what to do.

That's why New Year's resolutions don't work. I have to celebrate by Friday if I've decided I'm going to be on a diet. It doesn't last very long. The flesh is hostile to God and hostile to authority in any form. And it's very easy to say, "I want to serve you wherever, Lord. And so I'm sure it's going to be a startup because I don't, frankly, work very well under other people's authority because they don't do it right." Well, that's true. You may see things that they don't see. They see things you don't see.

Have you learned to work at peace under other people's authority, even though they don't do things right, according to your view? Have you learned to cooperate and contribute well in that setting? Then the Lord may do the startup.

They want to just jump for the successful startup and usually it doesn't work that way. The Lord uses His word to sift and sort us, to set us free from things that are actually holding us back from where and how He wants us to serve.

The word is for discernment. That's the point He is making here of looking between the soul and the spirit and joints and marrow: of going internal, what's going on on the inside. The outside may look stellar, but what's going on on the inside?

Many young marriages go through this where I'm dreaming of all the wonderful parts (which are part of it!), but I haven't really learned to love sacrificially. None of us have. It's a process to learn to do that.

Especially nowadays when people are single long, they've developed a lot of habits and a lot of things that must be in place for life to be good. The sink has to be clear of air or whatever it is. Those turn into major argument points.

Instead of realizing we both have a lot to grow, we both have a lot of learning how to love, how to in covenant commitment to bless the other over a lifetime, learn to communicate, learn to forgive, be patient, work out, take all the stuff I know in theory from Scripture and now it's lab time to work it out in practice. The blessings and the joy is there step by step as we do, but it's a process and there's a lot of dying to the flesh that has to go on, but it's good.

The resting is really resting in the Lord's way as we deal with the big challenges of life instead of trying to solve it ourselves, make happen what we think needs to happen. Instead, going to the Lord:
"What's your way?
How can I serve as part of your work in a broken world with broken people, including in me?"

As we do, as we learn to rest that way and go to Him with, "I don't know what to do with this, but thank you for it.
How do I grow?
How can I bring you into a broken situation?"
Then I have the joy of partnering with the Lord and then long-term start to see the freedom of it.

So that's plenty for tonight. Let's pray and then we're glad to hang out for questions, comments, or anything.

> Lord Jesus, thank You.
> Thank You that You call us to the much more.
> Thank You that You haven't just put us in this world to struggle it out ourselves.
> Thank You for the wisdom of Your word that shows us what's going on on the inside so that we can join You from the heart and dwell in peace, even in the midst of scary and overwhelming situations.
>
> Lord, may we join You and keep steeping ourselves in Your word with ears open.
> And Lord, show us where our ears have been getting closed because of bitterness or anger or feeling sorry for ourselves or grumbling.
> All of these things we assumed would be part either from our past or from what looks good in current culture.
> All of that. Leadership that isn't perfect, all those areas where we want to make it happen the way we think it should instead of may we go to You with thanksgiving, with trust, and be softening our hearts to You, eager to hear, knowing that You are good and that Your ways are good.
>
> Thank You that You are patient with us as we grow.
> Strengthen us to be patient with others and serve You well, no matter what others do or don't choose.
> Thank You, Lord, in Your name.
> Amen.
