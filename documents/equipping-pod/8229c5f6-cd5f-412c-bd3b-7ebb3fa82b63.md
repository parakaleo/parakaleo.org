Welcome. If you read the announcement sent out not too long ago, tonight we will be briefly back in 1 Corinthians 10 to really solidify what are the four areas where all of us as people tend to fall off, where we can, even as believers, start experiencing experiential death in our lives.

Paul says it is an example for us on whom the ends of the ages have come. That certainly applied to the Corinthian church as he has already in the Corinthian letter been addressing all of these issues that are causing a lot of problem in their fellowship.

These same areas show up in our lives and the lives of everyone else you will be in touch with. It is very helpful, very insightful for discernment. If I’m not feeling close with the Lord or someone I’m helping or feeling discouraged, driven, signs depressed, signs that all is not well.

These are four good areas to pray and ask the Lord about to get at the root of what is causing separation and trouble. The Lord is there, but why am I not experiencing the abundant life? Why don’t I have joy?

As we saw last week, but will really solidify this week, these are four basic areas where we as human beings tend to fall into old patterns, develop new ones that cause separation in our walk with the Lord, if you’re talking with a believer, or it can just plain raise havoc with an unbeliever.

It is very helpful. Then we will look briefly at the end of Joshua, Joshua 24, because Joshua brings up these same areas. Not surprising. It applies humanly.

Then we will look at Joshua 1, Steve’s calling passage, which is full of so much hope. What is the equipping? Joshua was a young leader who was walking strongly with the Lord, filled with the Spirit for his office through the laying on of Moses’ hands.

We looked at the history of that last week. Now we get to dive into what was his equipping and how is that our equipping or equipping enabling others to enter into the Lord’s promises, because that’s what they were doing historically at that point, but we get to do in our own lives.

We have a lot to cover, but it’s very practical.

As we noted last week, the issue is the importance of going beyond just participating in the corporate aspects of fellowship. It’s not just the group things that we do together and the group things that we’ve experienced, but it’s necessary to address and break out of the influences that hold us back from entering into true relationship with the Lord and really taking charge of our individual lives. As we noted in Genesis one, God created us in His image and commissioned us to rule, to manage the affairs of life the way He does. Initially, the human race was given rule over the realm of living beings. Then with Israel, it's a geopolitical territory. With us, it's the territory of our individual personal lives. That leads to healthy relations with others, but it starts with a healthy relationship with the Lord regarding my own life and taking charge of what's in my mind, my attitudes, and the words and actions that come out of it.

It's easy to misunderstand the concern about these examples because we did just look at a series of examples when a number of people died physically right then. A lot of people did. And so we do see death at all stages in redemption history.

Genesis 3 and following up to the flood, we have the effects of death through disobedience, through deciding not to trust the Lord, but to trust a usurper, a pretender, a deceiver. The result of that was that the first couple lost the wonderfully close relationship that they had with the Lord.

It's rather wonderful thinking of what it would have been like before the fall, given that they recognized the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day. That was familiar, or they couldn't have recognized it. It would have been a strange sound. Evidently, the Lord typically checked in at the end of the day, "Let me see what you've done today. Let us rejoice together about what you've done," watching things grow, bloom, bear fruit. Caring for the garden was a joy, a delight, and satisfying.

Then the moment that we have described in scripture of hearing the sound of the Lord in the garden and hiding in fear demonstrates a very serious death in the quality of their relationship with the Lord. Instead of being delighted and resting in His love and being in intimate fellowship with Him, they were afraid of Him because they had disobeyed. And so there's death there.

Then in the nation of Israel, it moves to the physical realm. The death there that we have in these examples is large scale. It is an unmistakable demonstration of the implications of their disobedience. It needed to be very visible, or the people wouldn't get it. There are long-term consequences. There's death that takes a long time to develop. But there has to be something immediate when it's teaching time.

Now, with little children, we can't let them do things that are harmful for a long, extended period of time until the natural consequences that are harmful to them come. We also can't let them do things that are immediately, especially life-threateningly dangerous.

Now we'll be moving into the personal dimension. The reason Steve is mentioning this is we had a couple of people who kind of panicked over this: Is the Lord about to zap one of us as an example for us? The answer is no. These were people who were leaders, who were hardened against the Lord, who had seen His amazing provision and care for 40 years, and deliverance from slavery, and nothing that He revealed changed them at all. They constantly were complaining, constantly wanted to go back to Egypt as if that was the wonderful place. These people were leading the people into that, which had deadly consequences, but most of that on the natural level is long-term.

As necessary as these people leaders were leading the people astray, the Lord had to make it clear not to follow them and that following them would have dire consequences.

It is not to say that we can expect that if we make a false move, we and everyone in our household will suddenly drop dead physically. The Lord is amazingly patient and lets people continue in wickedness far longer than any of us would and continues to reach out.

We just wanted to address this briefly because it really bothered a couple of people who were listening in. After this first example, the sin of the golden calf, the Lord reveals His character to Moses. In chapter 34 of Exodus, the Lord, the Lord God compassionate. The word is built on the root, the word womb. It’s a mother’s compassion for the child of her womb, the Lord’s compassion for the children of His creating, and compassionate, gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and truth—so that’s an assurance to the people after it was necessary to have some drastically visible immediate consequences to fighting off the Lord.

So we notice there are categories here. These are not just some random examples. These actually highlight the areas that are most important.

The first issue was idolatry. Exodus 32. It’s in the golden calf. “Do not be idolaters,” as some of them were, and then refers to the ungodly sexual celebration of what is not the Lord’s design. But the issue is being idolaters.

An idol is something that is an image that represents, communicates what it is that people think will give them life, what they think is essential for life. An idol’s an image. We are images; we’re not idols. We do idolize some people as celebrities and think that life will happen if we’re like them. And that’s similar to this. But it’s also similar in that such celebrity idols who get celebrity worship are just as false as images of what real life looks like and where to find it.

The issue there is idolatry, which is the first issue that the Lord brings up in the Ten Commandments. First is the positive, “No other gods before me.” And then, more specifically with the idols, “No other gods beside me.” Life comes from the Lord God and the Lord God only—true life. And there are no substitutes. There are no alternatives. The second issue with the immorality that came about through the Moabite women coming, inviting the Israelites to party with them, and then worship with them. And then trying the Lord, testing the Lord, saying, we don't like this. And then the grumbling that was against leadership.

Let's make this more general and what applies at all times: idolatry, fundamental. Expecting to find life from something other than the Lord. And the idols we think of, the physical statues, statuettes, those are merely representations, physical representations. The issue is the conceptual idol, the conceptual image of where life is to be found, whether it's associated with any sort of a physical or graphic representation or not.

For them, this is what they carried with them. These were idols that came from their time in Egypt and earlier. But the Aaron's talking about, give me, you know, we don't know what's happened to Moses, so give us a God and lead us back to Egypt. He said he threw the gold they gave him into the fire and out came this bull calf. He was trying to cover his behind.

What this was, was returning to idols from their past. If you don't know what to do, it's easy to head back into what was familiar to me from my culture, from my family. It's those, what comes immediately to mind when we're not sure what to do. And that's what this was.

They actually had not left any of those idols behind, which we will get later in Joshua 24. They packed them with them. And we pack them with us. There are times in our lives. Don't take any space in our luggage. There may be things associated with them that do. What shows up, and this is true of believers as well as unbelievers, is the death is what shows up.

Why am I not feeling close to God? Why am I feeling depressed or driven or angry because it's my idea of what I need to be or do to be successful isn't seeming to happen? A very common one on campus and as we also work with various alumni fresh out of school and in the work world, it's easy to make the, just continue the idol from family and from culture.

I need to be the very top, the very best for my worth, whether it's in my classes, my PhD work, my work, secular work, once I graduate. And then if it's not happening, then depression. And if it looks like it is happening, drivenness to accomplish it.

We've known med school professors who are driven to be the most popular, voted the most popular by the students and will sacrifice anything for it—marriages, families, physical health. We've known researchers do the same thing where that idol that they grew up with and were trained into, they have packed it along with them. It is still a strong sense of their worth. And so they're driven to accomplish it. This is what it takes to have life. And if it's not happening, then depression. These are the givens. The givens that arise out of the cultural heritage, social influences, these are the things that we have acquired and are just the way it is, the way it should be.

One wonderful thing about marriage is that every marriage requires some sorting and reconsidering because everybody comes into marriage with certain givens. And suddenly, because that's just the way you do it. And then you get married and you find out, oh, that's the way my family did it. And her family or his family doesn't do it the same way. "Hmm. That's not everybody. That's not an absolute." And  naturally, it can cause major fights, but in the Lord it's an opportunity to say "is this actually an absolute?" Is it anywhere in Scripture? I know I think it should be, but it's not. And if it's not, it's not an absolute. And then it's an opportunity with the Lord to say what do we as a couple with the Lord want to carry into our lives. That's a reflection of who the Lord has made us and what do we want to teach our children, etc.

The issue here is the traditions from family, culture, society, and so forth that actually are not in accordance with the Lord's plan. That's the issue here.

So, first of all, these are the givens. We don't know where Moses is, but we know what to do. This is influence they had brought along with them.

Now, this second one. The issue here is not so much what they did, but the issue here that we carry forward is this is entering into ungodliness because of the influence of the people I am living among now. And people around us are constantly urging us to join into things that are not pleasing to the Lord. And so that's the second channel of influence and of attack on our walk with the Lord.

An example, again, from the campus is that there's a lot of urging to sleep around. You're not home anymore. You're losing out. You should go ahead and sleep around and really live. And we've even had parents urge their kids to do that, to find out who they are as a man or a woman. And we've had it with parents from both sexes.

One that's going around that I've heard in recent years is if you're getting excited about some guy, this was among women, but I know it's with guys too. And you know that it's not good to actually establish a relationship with them, go dive into pornography and take care of your desires that way. And then it'll bring you clear. And so there's a lot of urging to using sexuality to deal with issues.

When I was in high school at parties, I'd have people telling me, "You're not having any fun. You need to have a drink." Because I didn't. I didn't drink and I wasn't interested in it. And that's part of the thing is, you know, you're missing out. FOMO is a big fear of missing out, is a big factor in this and wanting to fit in. One more is anorexia. We've helped a number of female students who've gotten almost to the edge of death with anorexia, starving themselves. Some women have said, "The only way I can get a date is if I am the top in my field. I'm an exciting person to be around. Lots of fun and very athletic and skinny and gorgeous. And if I don't do all of those things, I'm never going to have a date. And how can I do that? How can I be all of that? These are influences that come from those around us.

Now, the third one: let's try the Lord, test the Lord. What was this? Put in contemporary terms, "I didn't sign up for this". They were objecting to the way the Lord was leading them and that He was not providing what they wanted. "We expected cruise cuisine and that's not what we're getting". Yes, the Lord was providing. "And we're sick of this manna". Sick of this? What is it? That's what manna means. The point is, "I thought we were going into the promised land and we've been out in this desert all this time." But the reason you're out in the desert was because I tried to take you into the promised land. "But I'm tired of process. I want the goodies now. I'm tired of the process it takes to get there." It's easy for all of us to fall into that. And again, this is with the Lord, not just with whatever else.

We've seen people in marriages on this. "I didn't sign up for this. I signed up for the fun but not for the oh yes we said the traditional vows for better for worse but not this."

Those are the three essential things: just following what comes naturally to me because of all the influences that have come down to me; wandering off to things that other people around me, people are encouraging me to engage in things which are not pleasing to the Lord; objecting to the way the Lord is leading my life. And then the fourth was grumbling, and this was grumbling against the leaders that the Lord had appointed. That is fighting against those who are trying to encourage the people to respond to the Lord and do things the way He is calling them to do.

Let's jump to Joshua 23:14. Joshua starts by calling them to do what the Lord is calling them to do and then he's recounting what the Lord has done with them. And then the warning **"just as all the good words which the Lord your God spoke to you have come upon you, so the Lord will bring upon you all the threats until He has destroyed you from off this good land the Lord your God has given you"** because He presented them with alternatives, and they divided the people up and half of the people stood on one mountain and half on another mountain with a valley in between. They recited from one side what the Lord promises if you follow Him faithfully and what the Lord says will happen if you don't.

And that is the issue right here. Are you going to follow Him or are you going to fight Him? Then it says, (Joshua 23:16) **"when you transgress the command of the Lord your God which He commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the Lord will burn against you and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which He has given you."**

And, of course, there are no other real gods, but the point is other so-called gods, other supposed sources of life. And so they've been confronting them with these two things, the promises and the warnings, again and again.

And then, in chapter 24:2, Joshua said to all the people, **"The Lord God of Israel from ancient times, your fathers lived beyond the river, [That is the Euphrates] Terah, the father of Abraham, father of Nahor, they served other gods.

I took your father Abraham from beyond the river, led him through all the land of Canaan, multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac. Isaac, I gave Jacob and Esau, and Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess him, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egyptand. I sent Moses and Aaron and I plagued Egypt by what I did [he just neatly omitted 430 years of their being taken from being honored guests to being slaves] and I plagued Egypt, but what I did in its midst and afterwards, I brought you out.

I brought your fathers out from Egypt. You came to the sea. Egypt pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. But when they cried out to the Lord, He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon them, covered them. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt.

You lived in the wilderness for a long time. Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan, and they fought with you and I gave them into your hand. You took possession of their land and destroyed them before you.

Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel. He sent and summoned Balaam, the son of Baor, to curse you. But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you. And I delivered you from his hand.

You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. When the citizens of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Gergeshite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, as I gave them into your hand, I sent the hornet before you. I drove out the two kings of the Amorites from before you, not by your sword or bow. [You did not have to drive them out. I used other agents to get them out.] I gave you a land on which you did not labor, cities which you did not build, and a land you lived on which you did not labor, cities which you had not built, and you have lived in them. You're eating in the vineyards, olive groves, and so forth that you did not plant.

Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and truth."**

Not be terrified of the Lord, but take seriously that your attitude towards the Lord God is a life or death matter because He is the source of all life. And blow Him off, and the result will be death in many different forms.

**"Now, therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and truth. Put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt and serve the Lord."**

He's saying, you guys are still trucking these gods around. You got them stuffed in your baggage.

Verse 15: **"If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve. What are the gods which your fathers served, which are beyond the river, or the gods of the Emirates in whose land you're living?"** Notice the same choices that were there in Corinthians. That which has come down to you as your heritage, your natural heritage, apart from the Lord, or the influence that comes to you from the people among whom you are living, or the Lord. There are only three alternatives. It's those three.

**And the people answered, and he said, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord." And the people answered and said, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods. But the Lord our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, who did these great signs in our sight and preserved us through all the way we went among all the people through whom we passed. And the Lord drove out from before us all the people, and we will serve the Lord, for He’s our God."

And Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the Lord. For He’s a holy God, a jealous God. He will not forgive you transgressions or sins if you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods."**

By the way, remember, they've got them with them. They're still swirling them away, thinking, "I'm going to cover my bases. I want to follow the Lord, but I want these other things, too, just in case."

**"And if you forsake the Lord and serve, He will not forgive the transgressions of those who would forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods."**

Now, this is not saying just if you do something bad, you're going to get clobbered. There are real consequences to doing what's not good. But this is talking about "where are you looking for life?" And if you turn away from the sole source of life and try to find life elsewhere, you're not going to find life.

And it's back and forth several times. "You're not going to trust the Lord." "Oh, yes, we will." "No, you won't." "Yes, we will." Joshua points out the same three options. There are only three options. We live in the center of that tug of war all the time.

Back to the opening paragraph, the first nine verses of Joshua 1, which is the Lord's calling to Joshua, and it's the passage the Lord used to show me, "I'm calling you to this same thing in principles." We know that each one of you are in the position of Joshua saying, "As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."

And so Joshua 1 describes what the Lord called him to build in so that he could successfully lead people into the Lord's promises. And that's what we get to do as people who are devoting ourselves to the Lord and seeking to both live that way ourselves and be effective.

[mic cut off for about 15 seconds]

Remember, the grumbling does not have to do with which choices. The grumbling is against those who are trying to lead the people into the appropriation of the promises. That is the issue.

When we get to Psalm 95, Hebrews 3-4, we will address the generic issue of not entering into the promises, not for specific issues.

We are all called to encourage one another day after day. Every believer is to be encouraging fellow believers to enter into what the Lord has promised, the new life, the life of new life by the Spirit, replacing the idolatrous influences, the false life, wherever it comes from, from our heritage, from influences around us, to choose the Lord and to notice where we are consciously or unconsciously choosing other things, either from our background or from the influences around us.

Joshua is called to do this with the whole nation of Israel. I'm glad I don't have that responsibility. There are about two million people. That's a few more than I can handle.

If you reread Exodus, you will find again and again they are grumbling people. Grumbling about everything. Grumbling against Moses and grumbling against the Lord. Now, let's come back to Joshua's calling and recognize that it applies to every believer and encouraging one another. There are individuals who are especially called to make this their ministry, which is what the Lord has called us to, Erica and me, and to try to help people to understand how to appropriate the promises and take charge of the domain that is given to us individually.

And that is the domain of our personal lives.

We've gone from the Lord's provision to the human race, to the more specific provision to the nation of Israel, which was not meaning others were to be shut out. It was to be a model and a message to all the nations of the world everywhere at all times.

And now it's on the personal level, which of course is individual, and then out of that relationships with each other, etc. It came about after the death of Moses. We talked about who and what, when we first looked at this a couple of weeks ago.

"Moses is dead". Well, what is Moses' role? His role is to bring them out of Egypt. It was not to take them into the promised land. That's Joshua's role. And Joshua succeeds Moses in that.

Moses corresponds to the evangelists in the church today. Moses brought them out of being under the control of the powers of the world of the time. Evangelists bring people out of being controlled by all sorts of sins, idolatry in its various forms, mostly intangible.

But then, after you come out of Egypt, after you come out of that bondage, that's not where things are supposed to stay. Now, we're supposed to take up what is available to us to take charge of the various aspects of our life.

It came about after the death of Moses, the servant of I Am. We've known some very effective evangelists, and they really are not generally the best disciplers, mentors for people in the new life. They are constantly seeing more people who need to come to Jesus in the first place. And it's wonderful. And they need to keep doing their job.

We're all to evangelize. We're all to proclaim the good news to unbelievers. We're all to help fellow believers take hold of their prerogatives in the new life, to rule with Jesus and subdue the flesh and supplant the habits of sin with the habits of righteousness.

But again, there are different gifts which serve different functions in the church, and that's the issue here. The issue is not just coming out of the world into the church, and it's not just sitting for an hour on Sunday morning.

It's about what's happening in your life. The thing that's so important about this is so many believers are so glad that they've been saved from the penalty for sin. But they're still struggling with the practices of sin. And this is where a lot of believers become really discouraged and start to think, "oh, I guess it's just once we die physically on Earth and go to heaven, then all this stuff will happen". And of course, there will still be more to finish off at the twinkling of an eye, but we can make huge progress.

The thing is, yes, once we get to heaven, it will all be complete. But in the meantime, God doesn't intend us just to sit here clutching our boarding pass, hoping that we'll make it through the arrival inspection and know that our visa is good.

That's the thrust of our ministries, to equip people, to help people actually to enter into the power of the progress, the wonder of the new life as we take charge of area after area of our life and dig deeper and deeper into these habits and replace them with habits of righteousness.

The Lord spoke to Joshua, son of Nun. Joshua is the same name as Jesus, Yeshua. It means he saves. When we pray in the name of Jesus, we're praying in the name of the God who saves. We are saying that what we're praying is to carry forward and to appropriate and benefit from His saving work.

Joshua has been trained up under Moses. So, there's continuity here, but there's a new phase, a new era. Moses, my servant, is dead, so now arise. Time to get up and get going. Cross this Jordan, you and all those people.

We talked about the Jordan, and Jordan means descending. If you just got into the Jordan right now, it's not such a terribly huge river, but it's kind of like the Colorado River down the Grand Canyon, which is only a trickle compared to what it was.

You have to go across the current, the natural flow from Lebanon, where the snow is, where the water comes from, and then goes down, down, down, down, down to actually the lowest place on the face of the earth, the Dead Sea, which is dead because nothing can live in it.

All the water keeps coming down. It keeps carrying salts and other things with it. Then the water evaporates. You really can't swim in the Dead Sea. You float, whether you like it or not. Then you get out and you're all instantly crusted in salt.

You've got to go against the flow.

"You and all his people to the land I am giving to them. I have given it to you. I am giving it to you. I will give it to you."

What's done is He's given us title to it. And he's destined us to take it. He will give us the fullness of it and the fullness of what the earthly reality represents and which I am giving to them.

It's a constant, ongoing process. "Every place in which the sole of your foot treads in it, I have given it to you." There's the "I am giving," "I have given it." This is how I spoke to Moses. Wherever you go in life, I intend you to be my executive manager in that place. I say executive manager. It's not like being a slave or even being a line manager.

A slave just does what he has to do and doesn't have any choice at all. A line manager has a punch list of things to do to do his job. There's the opportunity to do it well.

But an executive manager is given a calling, is given a person's purpose, is given an objective. How to make it happen in practice is up to that executive. That's the kind of management He’s given us.

He gives us possession. He gives us title. He gives us the right to rule, to manage, but the results will be according to how good a job we do. How good a job we do is measured in the relationship between the responsibility that's entrusted to us and what we actually do.

The management is to take charge of our own lives, how we partner with the Lord, how we impact others as part of His work.

We all know the human race and its charge for the creation and the living beings. We've done a good job in some places, and a terrible job in others. All the concerns about wildlife and the environment are criticism and efforts to correct and improve that which is responsible or is given to the human race as a whole.

This then is geopolitically, and it's to be a model for all the nations everywhere now specifically.

So what is corresponding to us from the wilderness? They know about that. Wilderness is wilderness because it doesn't have the water that Lebanon has.

Lebanon, remember, means white thing. Why is it white? Same reason the Sierra Peaks used to be white. They still are but we're losing a lot of the snow cap, and that's going to be an issue. It is an issue already.

This Lebanon, the source of the water, the river that flows down there, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. This is where they came from.

Notice the link here with 1 Corinthians 10. "This is, I've given you the territory that goes all the way back in your heritage." So the Lord has given you the prerogative to deal with all the things that have come from your heritage.

All the land of the Hittites, representative, as we noted, for all the people in the land, the land of the people who are living here now, all the way, as far as you can go on land, to the sea, and beyond the sea, then you connect with the other nations. That's your territory.

**"No man will stand before you."** That is, no one can succeed in opposing you all the days of your life. How is that possible? **"As I was with Moses, I am with you. [I will not slack off.] And I will not abandon you."** Now, I look at this verse 5. **"No man will be able to stand before you or oppose you successfully all the days of your life."** Well, there are lots of people and there's lots of opposition that's not human that is much stronger than I am. But I am not alone. Nothing is stronger than the Lord.

So, apart from the Lord, I can get clobbered, discouraged, and beaten down. The Lord cannot be defeated in any sense. When I am with the Lord, no one, nothing can successfully oppose us.

So He is the big guy standing with me, the little one. And part of the theme of Joshua is the battle belongs to the Lord. But I have to head into it.

As we take charge of parts of our lives, old habits that may be very deep, and as the spies went into the land and said, "Yep, it's fantastic, but there are giants and there are cities fortified to heaven. We can't take this on." We can't by ourselves. But there are those big areas of our lives that are the habitual again and again-and with the Lord strengthening us, we can take those on. And that gives a lot of hope.

There is an implicit warning in this. If I try to do this leaving the Lord out of the picture, I will fail. The opposition is too great for me. If I stick with the Lord, I will succeed because He always succeeds. The message: stick with the Lord.

I love the way it is put in Philippians 4, where we have spent time recently. "I am with you always." The Lord is at hand, as was stated there. Many times we are told this.

Probably most of you have heard me mention a friend who was my best Bible study buddy for years. When he was in the army, he wrote to me and said, "I need prayer. I have a recurrent image that keeps coming to my mind. I'm sitting across a table from Jesus. He is looking intently at me. I am staring intently out the window."

I love that as a picture because that is exactly the opportunity we have. Anytime we want to rely on Him for fellowship, companionship, strength, guidance, whatever it is, He is always right there. The only thing that is a variable is whether I am paying attention to Him, counting on Him, talking with Him in prayer, and following Him. That is the only difference.

**"Be strong and courageous. For you shall cause this people to possess the land which I swore to their fathers to give them."** That is what we are talking about. That is the issue that 1 Corinthians 10 addresses, and that Psalm 95, Hebrews 3 and 4 address, where we go next week. And this to me is a great cause of hope.

I looked at this and said, wow. That is where my fulfillment lies in ministry: causing people to take up the inheritance that is theirs and manage life successfully together with the Lord and deal with the issues in their life that are defeating them, dragging them down, frustrating them, and enslaving them. And that's what I want to do. That's what I see that I can help with among God's people. But what does it take? Be strong and courageous. Strong in what? Keeping my attention on the calling. My individual calling, yes, but the calling of all of us from the Lord. My purpose, my objective, my goal has to be from the Lord. And that's where my strength comes from.

Many of you have heard me say my greatest strength in ministry is my great weakness. If I don't see it on the pages of Scripture, I cannot have confidence in offering it as counsel to anyone.

So, the strength is initiative. The courageous is response. Because I've got the calling. I've got the Lord. I've got the giver of life who makes me strong. But there is opposition. "No man will stand before you all the days of your life." What is that talking about? Opposition. There will be opposition.

As we try to take possession of what the Lord has promised us, as we try to help other people to take possession of it, there will be a lot of opposition. There will be opposition from without, there'll be opposition from people who are not the Lord's, and contexts in which I'm working, speaking to cooperate with unbelievers as well as believers.

There are people in the church who will fight hard against the very thing they need to hear and will even try to interfere with people ministering to others because the issue that the counselor is, whether formal or not, we all counsel, we all advise each other with good advice from the Spirit and not good advice from the flesh when we get deceived into that.

There's always opposition. There are people who will fight in a group setting among believers. They'll fight against what they actually know is true because they're fighting against submitting to that wisdom from the Lord themselves.

And don't forget, the enmity is also within my body. The Holy Spirit is in my body, giving me life and guiding me and empowering me. But the drive to do my own thing is within me. The flesh, as it's called, the flesh which does not do its job of proclaiming the good news from the Lord, but is trying always to proclaim false good news, so-called good news, which is actually bad news, if you take it.

My will is apart from the Lord. But as a new creature in Christ, my will is to do God's will. My will at heart. But there are a lot of areas in my life where what I have established and committed, consciously or unconsciously, my will to, as my objective, is not from the Lord. And that's what this is all about in my life.

So be strong and courageous because there will be huge opposition. We are not trying to defend ourselves against the evil one. The evil one is attacking us and attacking the Lord. What I mean by that is there is such a sense at many times that we live in the age of the church beleaguered rather than the church triumphant. And if there's a symbol, you know, Jesus, the Lion of Judah, not just lying, lying out, lounging, waiting for somebody to bring Him some food. The Lion rampant, the Lion on the move, the Lion going to battle.

But it takes courage. There was a time on campus when there was an issue that came up where the university was pushing something that was not from the Lord. We had our meeting at the beginning of the year of all the campus ministers. The question was, what are you excited about this year? One after another was excited about this move. It was a move to give married student housing to couples who are not married.

I spoke up and said I was concerned about this. Among other things, it's not fair to the married couples who have a real need for the separate housing from all the singles. There were 10 other evangelical ministers in the room, and I was the only one who said anything about it. I asked one of the others after the meeting, "How come none of you mentioned this as a concern?" The answer I got was, "Prophets get killed."

The strong and courageous here is persisting and bringing, being able to bring people in, especially. There are times where it's easy to feel weak because it's such a long process and the needs are so deep. Or, where do we even start? There are so many issues that need to be addressed even with a single person. It takes being strong in the Lord and courageous and discerning.

Lord, what's the first thing that is a showstopper, a lifestopper for this person? How can I help them to make progress? But it always takes strength from the Lord and courage. And going in, as Steve was saying, into situations where we would be afraid to go otherwise.

We've been in quite a few, each of us, meetings at Stanford where the evangelicals are the enemies, and we're trying to reeducate the evangelicals. It can be scary going in, but saying, "Lord, I'm going in because of Your calling. You go with me. You're the big guy. I get to just pray, bring Your presence, be part of helping those who have ears to hear." And it's always led to very special opportunities.

One very positive thing in all of this was when a team of outside observers and evaluators were brought from other universities to look at the religious program at Stanford. We talked with some of those people on that committee. We were told, "We're going to drain the swamp." They actually were all from pretty liberal universities. And we thought, "yeah, we're probably the swamp".

It actually turned out, what they did was... The result of that was the retirement of the most rabidly anti-evangelical person on the staff. But we had to stand our ground and speak what we knew and what we believed, even though we suspected that that was going to be more suicidal than helpful. It turned out it was fine. So the Lord does lead in His triumph.

Now, let's look at these last three verses here: Only be strong and very courageous. Keep, safeguard the instruction to do according to all that Moses, my servant, commanded you. Do not turn from it to the right or the left so that you may act wisely wherever you go. Now, it really means so that you may achieve success wherever you go.

It's the same term that was in Genesis 3, desirable to make one wise, and that translation that's cast in concrete in all our English editions is misleading because we usually think of wisdom as philosophical wisdom, the sage pronouncement sort of thing. But it's practical. It is wisdom, practical wisdom, and the practical wisdom is the instruction that the Lord has given us in His word. And that's the way to succeed.

**This book of the law, the book of instruction, shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night.** It's like ruminate.

The Lord characterizes us as sheep and He is shepherd. We're like sheep without a shepherd. He is the good shepherd. Being called sheep is not the most exalting label to have.

We had some students who had sheep. He had to take care of the sheep. He would say, "Sheep are the dumbest critters on the planet. They can get themselves into more trouble with nothing to do it with than you could imagine."

Anyway, this "meditate" means ruminate. The thing about sheep and goats and other ruminants is they don't just eat constantly. They don't get anything out of what they eat by eating; they get it by chewing cud. They have a multi-chamber stomach. They don't have several stomachs. They've got one stomach, but it's got different chambers. The stuff goes down into the first. Then later it comes up. This is why Shepherd Psalm says, "He makes me lie down in green pastures." Green pastures are great! It may seem like lying down on the banquet table, on the smorgasbord... All this stuff to eat! No, but don't eat: ruminate and chew it, and then it'll go to the second stomach and then it'll come up and you chew it some more and it goes into the third stomach and so forth. But you have stuff in all the stomachs and it's a constant juggling act. But there's lots and lots and lots of chewing on it, meditate on it, ruminate.

We use the word ruminate, which does mean to chew cud, literally. But we talk about ruminating on something as thinking it over continuously and again and again to get the meaning and the wisdom out of it. And that's exactly what this is.

The departing from your mouth is not just what you say to others. It is that. But they had a habit of ruminating on Scripture by speaking it out loud. They would mumble through passages. It wasn't really for anyone else to hear, but day and night, keep bringing it to mind, turning it over in your mind, getting more and more out of it so that you may literally keep to do. Now, our translations all like to say, "so you may be sure to do," "so you may be careful to do." No, this is not about intensity. It is keep. When you are in contact with the Word of God, decide that it's important enough to store it up and safeguard it. Don't just sit there and then get up and on the way out say, "very nice sermon, Pastor, thank you."

The keeping is an act of the will, not of the mind. Act of the heart, and the heart in Scripture is the core of our being. It's what drives life. That's evident when the Lord tells Noah, "the blood is the life." That's the key to unlock all of the message that God has written in human anatomy and physiology.

You go from there. OK, then what's the heart? Well, the heart is the driving force of the life of the body. And you go on from there. So, keep it. Don't just keep it in mind. Keep it in your heart. Commit to it. And commit to doing it. And you commit in preparation for doing it.

The key here is... You can't wait until the battle to decide what to do. We just read from Audie Murphy, America's most decorated soldier. He described, when he got into battle, he said, "I let my training and my instincts take over."

His instincts are what he developed. He was orphaned very young and had to take care of all the rest of the siblings. A lot of it was hunting food for them, squirrels and rabbits, initially killing them by throwing rocks at them. Then he got a slingshot and then he got probably a 22.

He got so good at hearing minute sounds in the woods that just from a sound, he knew exactly where an animal was and what kind of an animal, what size animal it was. He would not have to see it to turn and shoot it. He was a true sharpshooter, which then, but it was, it's that he committed himself to do what he was trained to do, what he was taught to do, and what he also learned and honed through experience.

So keep to do, two different steps, according to all that is written in it. When we have a chance when we're dealing with Scripture to commit ourselves, then that sets our heart. Then we'll learn more to understand it more deeply.

One way that I've thought of it is I treasure this up as the words, "this is where life is for me and for others." So I want to really understand it. I want to internalize it, make it part of my life, how I operate, how I think in order to do it. Then I have it to lead others into.

Everyone here is a believer and committed to doing this. But it's so easy to get busy and not get the time or not treasure the time when we have it. To really meet with the Lord, to hear from Him, to treasure up what He says, "this is where life is for me and for others."

And then walk in it myself. Then I'm in a position to help others. He will bring others who need to hear that truth. I've had key times when helping someone who had established very bad patterns. In this case, anorexia, almost died from it. I spent time in the Word, listening, treasuring it up to walk in myself. Then I would meet with her. Every single day, the Lord had prepared me with exactly what she needed to hear. Erica didn't know what was going to come up then, but it was always the Lord in her time with the Lord beforehand.

He always gave her what she needed. Always listening for me and for others. As we approach the Word this way, He is equipping us so that we have the words of life for family members when they're open to it and others. We can lead the way through how we live. If they can't hear it from words, show it. Then pray that it will make them hungry to hear what's behind it. He will often do that.

If we do this, then we will cause our way to thrive and you'll act wisely. Again, that same word: achieve success.

One more thing about this keeping to do, and that is an experience. I'll describe it as briefly as I can.

Training as a soccer referee is, and one of the more advanced training sessions for higher certification, we had a session on how to send off a coach. That is, what to do when you have a coach who is sufficiently uncooperative, argumentative, whatever, that it is necessary to order him as politely and effectively as you can to leave the field and the vicinity of the field.

I was driving home after that session and I was wrestling. I was fighting. I was wrestling with the Lord and saying, I don't ever want to do that. I don't ever want to have to do that.

And  how the Lord responded to me was he brought to mind, "Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution." Oh, that was my answer. Oh, this isn't my decision. I have just been told what the organization, which has decades of experience with thousands and tens and hundreds of thousands of people, has decided this is the way this unpleasant, uncomfortable, but occasionally unfortunately necessary situation is to be handled.

And so then I was immediately at peace. It's not my decision. It's their decision. My task is only to follow the procedures that the organization under which I'm serving has decided is what needs to be done.

And so, suddenly I was at peace. I had been wrestling really hard. All of a sudden I was at peace. And then I thought, if it happens, which I hope it doesn't, it may happen two weeks from now. Well, I got a surprise. It happened one week from then. It was a real mess. Several years later, there was an editorial in a newspaper talking about a soccer match in which there were a lot of people unhappy, blah, blah, blah, and so forth. And I recognized this person had been there at that game. And the thing that was affirming from the Lord about that was the statement in the article, "the only person who was calm at that field [and there were 150, 200 people there in various roles] was the referee." And that was the Lord.

But, again, the necessity of preparing ahead. In the military, that's what basic training is all about. Because if you get in a situation and you don't know what to do on the battlefield, you're probably dead.

Have I not commanded you? Third time: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed, for your God I am is with you wherever you go."

These are all triples of the given, the procedure, and the benefit. The first triple: "I'm giving you all of this territory."

The second triple, verse 6: **"Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to possess the land I swore to their fathers to give them, the territory of light."**

And then the third triple, verse 9: **"Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous, and do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God, I am, is with you wherever you go."**

We get the territory allotted to us. We get to lead people into that same blessing. And we get to grow really strong and close with the Lord.

The question came up last night with the students: What about those areas of fear? We all have fears going into ministry situations, ministry opportunities, and we're envisioning what it's like really without the Lord. We're looking at the circumstances. This is bigger than I am.

I've had the opportunity in recent years to walk alongside various former students who are going through the end of their lives. It's enormous in terms of the needs and the opportunities, bigger than I am.

But as I turn to Him and trust myself to Him, I'm feeding on His word, not just to fill my head and say, I agree with it. That sounds great, but internalizing it, welcoming it is where I walk.

Then I have that, that the Lord can use. And so I can be strong in Him. He's with me, the big Guy, with me, the little one. And courageous because I know He'll meet me and we will do it. We will go together and He will be guiding me.

The interaction, what the truth is that would be encouraging, how to pray it, how to encourage with it, how to give courage to those who are way in over their heads and frightened at the prospect of what's ahead. But again, seeing it, looking at the thing itself and the prognosis instead of walking it with the Lord. And one thing we've found is that the Lord rarely meets us ahead. We all want to be like Superman where we get in the phone booth, we get closed in our super dust, and we come out strong. But what we've found with the Lord is that usually He calls me into a situation that's bigger than I am. I entrust it to Him. I welcome Him, walking with Him in it. And it's as I get going that the Lord meets me and is there.

It takes the step of faith. It takes stepping forward in Him into what He calls and trusting Him that He will bring to mind the truth that is most encouraging, most helpful, most discerning at that point. I've experienced that so many times now with counseling, with teaching at conferences, where I'm going in fearful if it's just me. Am I adequate? Can I actually do this?

As He calls me, as I give myself to go with Him, knowing, thanking Him that He's there, thanking Him for His word that I've been steeping myself in and seeking to walk in myself, that He will connect all of that with exactly what the person needs to hear. I've seen Him do it again and again and again. It's easy to go in fearful and come out dancing with what the Lord did.

That's what this is talking about. When something is repeated three times, it's a Hebrew way of underlining it on a big level because it was verbal before ever written. How do you underline something that's verbal? You mention it two times, or if it's really important, three times. This is very important in order to lead others in successfully.

Let's pray.

> Thank You, Lord, that You are with us. You are our I AM God. Thank You that You strengthen us for what You call us to. And that You give us the wisdom for success, for fulfilling what You call us to, accomplishing Your work in our lives and the lives of others.
>
> Thank You for the privilege of getting to be part of enabling others to enter into Your promises and come forth from deep areas where they've been enslaved to habits of the flesh and of thinking that has caused a lot of death in their lives and the lives of those they impacted.
>
> Lord, strengthen every one of us as we seek You, as we know You have the words of life, as the disciples said to Jesus, "Where else will we go?" May we steep ourselves in Your word, internalize it, knowing that that's where joy in life comes from, an effective partnership with You to bless others.
>
> Thank You, Lord, for everyone here. Encourage every one of them and give them the joy of partnering with You and the people of their lives. In Your name, amen.
