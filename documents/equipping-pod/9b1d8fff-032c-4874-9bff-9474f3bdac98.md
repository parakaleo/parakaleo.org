> Oh, Lord, thank you that You are our living God and that You are right here with us wherever in the world we are. Lord, thank You that You train us up through the very choices that we make, through the choices of others, through circumstances, that all of it becomes a setting where we get to see You and grow in You and be equipped to come alongside of others who also are dealing with brokenness within themselves as well as in the world and in other people.
>
> Thank You that You are committed to us in Your covenant love, that we are indeed Your beloved, and You see us with eyes of love, no matter what's going on. You know the very core, and You know Your Spirit there as new creations. And You also know how far we have yet to grow into what You've given us. Lord, may we grow as quickly and deeply as possible to give You joy, us joy, those that we impact joy, and those that we serve.

> Thank You, Lord, for each one here so dear to You. Please open our ears to hear You and underline for each of us the truths that we're ready to trust You to walk into and help others. Thank You, Lord, in Your name. Amen.

As you remember, last week we were in Joshua 1, Steve's calling passage, and seeing the Lord's equipping and calling for that exciting time of trusting the Lord to enter God's promises, the promised land.

We saw from 1 Corinthians 10 that these, though they really happened with real people, they're also examples for us who live now. So we have much to learn.

Tonight we get into another passage that refers back to where we've just been. It's all tied together. But it's New Testament. This is Hebrews, especially chapters three and four. And we'll be in it for the next couple of weeks because there is so much that is very practically helpful for us and helpful for our own growth, helpful for others. We'll see that there is a rest that is available to the people of God, to all of us, that none of us have entered fully into yet.

A rest that we as believers and in the church, we leave so much of what the Lord is eager to have us enter into. We leave it on the shelf because we don't know it's there or we're doubting His goodness or, for a host of reasons, we've gotten diverted to other things that are looking for life elsewhere.

We'll be looking at what is that special quality of what's called rest in Hebrews. The Israelites entered into the land of promise, the land of rest, and it took strong trust in the Lord to be able to enter in and to dwell there.

The Lord's promised land was a place that took His power and presence to make it a place of rest. It was right between the two powerful empires of the time, the Tigris-Euphrates world and the Nile.

It took their trusting the Lord because all the time, one of those powers was wanting to go through, use them as a buffer zone or to travel through. Every spring, after they had grown and put in all the labor for the crops, there were raiders from all sides coming in to say, "Thank you for growing it. Now we'll take it. Hope you have something to eat."

We were in Israel years ago, hiking underground for whole days at times, where the Israelites went underground when the raiders came through. Wine presses, all sorts of things under the ground. It was limestone. They could carve it out easily, and there are miles of caves down there.

Whether it was entering into the land under Joshua or now, for us as believers, entering into the much more that the Lord wants to give us, it takes a strong trust in Him.

We'll be looking at what it is, what it takes, what blocks us from benefiting very much from it, and also how we can help others identify where they've gotten stuck and help them out.

There is a lot both for tonight and next week, and we'll be working with it.

One other note as we're in Hebrews, just historically, a tiny bit of history to tie with it, since I love history and the context.

Nobody knows for sure, even the early church, who exactly wrote it. People have put out maybe it was Paul, but it isn't quite his style. Maybe Apollos, maybe there are various, Luke.

It's clear it was written in the first century. Timothy is mentioned a number of times as being active, and they knew him.

It's probably before 70 AD, before the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, because the regular sacrifices are mentioned and had not been ended yet. So we can at least place about when it was written. And it's clear it was probably addressed to people who were from either Jewish background or who had come into a relationship with the Lord through Judaism because there's constant quotes from the Old Testament, and there's an expectation that they will recognize these and understand them.

And it's speaking to people who are tempted to revert to the old ways, either because they're afraid Jesus isn't enough, and they want to make sure to cover their bases with God, or pressure from the community.

A lot of them were in communities where they would be excluded. They would be the outsider still living in the community if they became Christians.

And that happens nowadays among the Muslims and other people where there's a lot of pressure not to receive the Lord because of peer pressure and ostracism around.

But we can revert to law very easily, even now. It's very easy, especially where work is evaluation-based, to start evaluating our own worth by our track record, and we assume that God does the same thing. And if you find yourself starting to struggle with your worth, feeling down, feeling like you didn't do very well, hashing over past things that you did, past not such great choices, chances are good that—as all of us do at times—we've reverted to law, where we've reverted to my worth and my standing comes from my track record.

So it's easy to revert to where these people were tempted to go. So this is calling us forth. And it's something that many, many, many in the church and among believers—none of us have entered into all of it. But the encouragement is to enter into much more.

Hebrews starts out, **"God, after he spoke long ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many ways, in these last days, has spoken to us in a Son."** Hebrews 1:1.

**"And we appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the world. He is the radiance of his glory and the exact representation of his nature, upholds all things by the word of his power."**

This is a parallel statement to how the Gospel of John begins: **"In the beginning was the Word. The Word was with God. The Word was God. This one was in the beginning with God. All things came into being by him. Apart from him, nothing came into being that has come into being. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it or could not overpower it."**

Both implications are true. This is fulfillment of God's intent in creating us in His image. An image is a representation. We are designed—every human being is designed—to be an accurate representation of the Lord God, the Creator, the Redeemer.

Jesus came to live as a human being and to do what God intended every human being to do. Jesus is the only person who has ever done that perfectly. And He is God.

This is the message of what God intended human beings to do. This is the demonstration.

Up to this point, He has talked about it. He has explained it. Now He has said, let me show you what I mean. Let me show you in human terms what I have been talking about. And so that's why the incarnation of Jesus. It is the Creator Himself showing us what a human life should be. That life is to enlighten us. The life was the light of men. It was to enlighten us as to what human life is all about, what life in God's image is all about.

The light shines in the darkness in a world that does not have the life of God clearly evident. We have this message. It is stated for us in John's gospel. Paul mentions it.

We have in Colossians that we **have been transferred to the kingdom of His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins, and He is the image of the invisible God.**

**All authorities have been created by Him and for Him. He is before all things. In Him, all things hold together. He is also the head of the body, the church, the beginning, the firstborn from the dead.**

That firstborn is—yes, He is the first chronologically to rise from the dead, to be raised from the dead. That then makes Him the firstborn, not because He arrived on the scene first, but because the firstborn is the designated leader of that generation. He is our head.

We are His body because of having His life in us. We give embodiment to His life.

As John tells us, as Jesus told the disciples the night before He was crucified, **"He who believes in me shall do the works that I do, and greater than these shall he do because I go to the Father."**

It explained His going to the Father was so that the Holy Spirit could be sent to live in believers and live through them, and thereby to make God visible in human terms through them—not just through Jesus, the perfect God-man—but through us who start out anything but perfect, who start out as thoroughly corrupted, distorted.

What Jesus told the disciples about doing greater than He did seems difficult to grasp because Jesus was perfect. How could we do better than that? Well, it's a matter of what the Father could show through Jesus and what He could not show through Jesus. What the Father is showing through us, who are the body of Christ, who are believers in whom the life of Christ dwells, but it dwells in sinful bodies, which will always be sinful until they die physically. We get to learn to take control of these bodies by the agency, the power, the guiding of the Holy Spirit. To take over territory of our lives that has been under the dominion of sin and has been expressing sin instead of righteousness, instead of the life of God, and take control of them and use them to show forth God accurately.

And that's what is greater, because Jesus could show the ideal, which He was, but He could not show the transformation. What we saw in Jesus is awe-inspiring. It leads us to worship and to recognize that He is God, but it leaves us without any hope of doing that because it is naturally impossible for us.

It is then giving us His Spirit to enable us to do that that makes it possible. In us, people can see the transformation and that's what gives them hope. It is not just that Jesus being perfect doesn't give us hope of being perfect; it gives us inspiration. The hope comes from seeing people actually transformed.

And that'sThat is what he'sHe is doing through us in our role as being created in the image of God, moreover, being recreated as new creatures in Christ by receiving the Holy Spirit so that His life dwells in us. As it grows, as we respond and apply it to more and more things, our lives go through visible transformation, which gives real hope to people of experiencing the same.

That's is a great, powerful venue that the Lord has given each one of usthat no. No matter what other people are doing in my family, in my workplace, wherever you are, it's is easy to focus on what they're are doing and how hard it's is making it for us. But what is always open to us is that I can grow in giving the Lord control of my thinking and attitudes and words and actions. I can bring more and more of the Lord's character into bad and difficult situations.

They need to see Jesus. I can bring Him to them in the way that I live and choose to live, choose to think, as opposed to just reacting to them. That door is always open to me. And then I am giving the Lord a powerful tool to work with in the lives of those around me. If they can't hear it, show it. I'm am never without agency.

We have what has been declared in the Gospels, what is declared in Paul, whose church letters are systematic instruction for how to live the new life by the Spirit. Here, in Hebrews, we have the same thing, but there's is a different angle and a different purpose for stating this each time. The fact that it occurs at each of these points helps point out to us how important this is, because this is the fulfillment of God's calling to us or creating us to display Himself.So he's—verse Verse three: "He is the radiance of His glory, the exact representation of His nature." That's this communication. Through incarnation, God's glory radiates. And that's, I think,That is what Paul is talking about, about Him being the light of the world, that He gives life. He gives, heimparts enlightenment of the truth of who God is and who we're created to be and who we are, who are responding to Him to let Him fulfill His purpose in us.

And so Hebrews goes on to talk about Jesus' relationship to the angels. **"When He made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high."** That's is the position of executive administrative authority. It is the CEO of the kingdom of God. It is the person who is charged with making the will of the Father happen.

**"And having become as much better than the angels, has He inherited a more excellent name than they?"** We don't need to go into the long comparison, though there are wonderful things in it that apply directly to us, between Jesus and the angels. Suffice it to say that the traditional comprehension was that the prophets spoke God's word because they had received God's word through the mediatorial agency of angels. That is why this discussion of Jesus being superior and the communication through Him being so superior to that through angels.

In our New Testament context in the church, this is not something that we are particularly concerned about. Picking up a couple of things here, a reference going back to Psalm 2 of the promise of being a father and that it's is a father-son relationship. This is not talking about generation. It's is not talking about giving birth to Him. It's is talking about roles. The Son is given responsibility to manage the Father's affairs and is expected to do so in a way that pleases the Father.

John's gospel, focuses on the relationship between Jesus and the Heavenly Father. Matthew, Mark, and Luke show Jesus' relationship with people, and each one addresses one of the divisions of mankind. Matthew is to the Semitic world, which is why it's is full of quotations from the Hebrew Bible. Mark is to the pragmatic world. Luke is personal.

Whenever I want to find a passage that talks about Jesus in intimate interaction with people, I'll look in Luke if I do not know where else it is. The so-called synoptics, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, view things from the same basic perspective. But John's gospel is different.

When you try to harmonize the gospels and put them all together, you can harmonize the synoptics. But adding in John is difficult. It can be done. It's been done beautifully. But it is different. It's talking about the relationship with the Father that is available to us as it was to Jesus. Because we are not merely children of God, but as we mature and are given executive responsibility by our Heavenly Father, then we are doing what we're doing in relationship to the Father. Jesus said, "I always do what pleases my Father." And we get to have that kind of relationship with our Heavenly Father.

Going on to Hebrews 2. Now we have the first of the warning or exhortation passages in Hebrews. Hebrews gives us a lot of information, doctrine, if you will, and then calls us to act on it. This is the first one of those calls to action.

**"For this reason [because of the superiority of the communication through Jesus over that of the Old Testament], we must pay much closer attention to what we've heard, lest we drift away."** That calls to mind the term for drifting away, which actually occurs in Luke 22 in the parable of the invited wedding guests who had accepted the invitation to the wedding. But then when the time came to join in the celebration, other things were more important.

That's what we're talking about. We're talking about when Jesus calls us into what He’s promised us. Are we interested? Remember, we noted there are—when we looked at Psalm 95—**"Come, let us worship and bow down before Him, worship the Lord, our Maker,"** and so forth and so on, because it's so wonderful.

And that's where the sheep of His pastoring, the people who He is pastoring, the sheep of His hand, are. And that's where the quotation that is part of many church liturgies wonderfully comes from. So we're not faulting that, but it stops. And that's actually in mid-verse in the Psalm that's being quoted. They do not go on to "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart," as in the day of Massah and Meribah.

That is one of the examples we looked at that Paul cites in 1 Corinthians 10. And then we see them elsewhere also. That's the one that had to do with discontent with what the Lord was doing. "This isn't turning out to be what I signed up for." And that's serious business.

When you decide that you want the blessings that God has to offer, are you accepting with it God leading you where He knows is best for you, and not just going where you already think it would be lovely to go?

So, **"For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we've heard, lest we drift away from it. For if the words spoken through angels proved unalterable, every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense."** The transgression is crossing the limit line, wherever the word has drawn it regarding that particular issue, and disobedience is disobedience in practice.

We're going to talk about a different kind of disobedience, which is critical to what we're looking at right now. But this is merely disobedience in practice. You break the rules, you pay the punishment. And that's the issue with law. And why can law not make us righteous before God? Why can't law reconcile us to God? Because law declares the standard. Law demands perfection. The law points out where we fall short, where we're failing. And the consequence of that is punishment.

The law can never make us acceptable to God because there's always something else that makes us unacceptable to God that law also points out. How should we escape if we neglect God? If we neglect so great a salvation?

Actually, it's the word neglect, which is the same Greek term as in Luke 22, the parable of the invited dinner guests. They're all invited, but when the time comes, they don't confirm it. "Many are called, but few are chosen" is something that there's a lot of confusion about in the church. Re chosen: it sounds like God calls a lot of people, but then He accepts only some of them and not the others. That's not what it's talking about. The choosing, we think chosen means is not a unilateral act on God's part. But what it says literally is many are called, but few are called out.

God calls to us. Actually, God calls to everybody. But only some are convinced to respond to the call. People respond freely to the promise of lovely things. There are so many who think, "Oh, yeah, I want to go to heaven. I want the big party in the sky." But they imagine it just to be more of the sinful stuff they've been pursuing on earth. That's not what God's is offering. They don't want to become like God. Wielding power, yes, but not to become like God in character anymore. They don't want to have the defects in them because of sin healed.

This is the issue. We've seen many over the years, and you probably know some too, who were involved even strongly as leaders in Christian fellowships during college, and then completely seemed to drift away and chalk it up as part of their college experience. And what we've seen is that with all of them, it was external to them. They enjoyed the fellowship. They might have even been leaders. They enjoyed the leading.

We've seen unbelievers who evangelized. I knew one who, when I was at Stanford, ended up at Labrie with Francis Schaeffer and was evangelizing. Everybody realized he had not actually submitted his life to the Lord. He was convinced of the philosophy. Francis Schaeffer had to take him aside and ask him to stop evangelizing because he was confusing people. I connected with him at Stanford. I've been serving as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital. As part of his human biology practicum, he wanted to come alongside me. I could tell the hound of heaven was on his tail because even if we hadn't talked about or prayed with the person, he would come out saying that person was a Christian with a capital C. He could see real faith and he was being drawn in. He could see the presence of God in other people. He said that was a Christian with a small c, someone who was religious, but it didn't seem to make any difference as they were facing hard things in the hospital.

He did come to the Lord, but we have known evangelists, student leaders, but it's all external to them. They haven't begun to grow yet. They haven't begun to welcome the Lord's transforming their lives. It's then that you really know that they're actually a believer and that they are going much deeper into what the Lord longs to give all of us. But it's easy to keep it all external and then drift. That's what the warning is here.

Hebrews goes on and quotes from Psalm 8: **"What is man that you remember him, or the son of man that you are concerned about him?"** That's not capital S son. This is written long before the incarnation. The son of man simply means someone who is born through human propagation.

**"You have made him for a little while lower than the angels. You crowned him with glory and honor, appointed him over the works of your hands. You put all things under and subjected under his feet, and then subjecting all things to him left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him."**

That's very easy to think that this is talking about Jesus. It's not. It's talking about all of us. It's talking about mankind. God did entrust the care of the world he created to us, to the realm of living beings, not the realm of nature. But we don't see human beings being in charge. We see human beings striving to get in charge of this, that, or the other thing, but we definitely are not on top of everything, as this describes.

Verse 9: **"But we do see him who has been made for a little while lower than the angels, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor."**

So we see that we haven't got it all together. But we look at Jesus and we see he does. The important thing is that he not merely lived the perfect life, but that crowned with glory and honor above that which even people in their best can do, but the suffering of death he was crowned with glory and honor that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. **"For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one. For this reason, He’s not ashamed to call them brethren."** And of course, from one, it is from one and the same heavenly Father. And that’s why Jesus is not ashamed to call us His brothers, regardless of human gender.

And saying, **'I will proclaim Your name to my brethren in the midst of the congregation. I will sing Your praise.'**

**And again, 'I’ll put my trust in Him.' And again, 'Behold, I and the children whom God has given me.'** Not Jesus’ children, but the children of God that God has entrusted to Jesus as the leader, trustee, steward of God’s sons, God’s children. At this point, sonship is a matter of maturity.

**So since the children share in flesh and blood, likewise He also, particularly the same, that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death—that is the devil—and might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives.**

It is really key that we understand this.

How did Jesus render the devil, the accuser who’s also the destroyer, powerless? Well, His power is that He holds over people because of their fear of death. So they’re afraid—FOMO for one thing, fear of missing out.

And so how did He render Him powerless? He demonstrated that death is nothing to be afraid of. If you’re trusting God, there is life after death. So death does not have the finality. Death doesn’t take everything away from you. And that changes it.

It makes me think of the inspiring, although tragic, story of a young boy in Africa during one of the rebellions, and he was about to be burned to death. It was under EDM. Yeah. And he was about to be burned to death and he announced, 'I’m not afraid of the fire that takes me to Jesus.'

And of course, Jesus taking our sins on Himself means that death is not just the entrance to judgment. No. Now we’re accepted by God.

And actually, this verse has been very powerful in counseling. I remember talking with a woman who was a determined atheist and she was toward the end of her life. And she had done what all of us tend to do, and that is through fear of death, through fear of not being in control, through fear of being with people who might not appreciate her, her life was becoming smaller and smaller.

She would only go where she felt like she was in control, only go where she felt she would be appreciated. And so her world got smaller and smaller and smaller. And all of us tend to do that as long as we let fear control us—that we want to stay where we at least look like we’re in control, feel like we’re in control more. And we don’t want to be around people who are challenging or not appreciative. And typically, a person's life gets smaller and smaller because of those types of fears. I shared this verse with her because there was some openness toward the Lord. And I said, you know, this is describing Jesus has come to set us free from what all of us tend to do, and you certainly have done.

Your life, from what she had just described, was smaller and smaller because of those types of fears. I said, Jesus has come to deliver you from that. She looked at me and said, "You're right. I built every bar. And I do not want out."

I told her, "You're living in a cage." She said, "You're right. And I built it. We just came to set you free from that cage." She said, "I don't want out of that cage. I built every bar myself. I have no intention of going outside."

She died that way. It was tragic. But it has been really helpful at times for people to see because of fear—fear of missing out, fear of not being in control—they start narrowing their lives down to, and Jesus has come to set us free from that.

I have used that quite a bit in counseling, and it has been very freeing to people to see Jesus' death and resurrection as part of that—that they don't need to be controlled by those fears anymore if they walk forward with Him in His life instead.

**"Deliver those whose fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. Assuredly, He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the seed of Abraham.**

The translation I'm looking at says descendant, and most modern translations say something like that—descendant, offspring, something like that. But the text says seed.

It is not those who have come down the line of family history from somebody—in this case, Abraham. Descendant describes the same relationship, but descendant describes an interracial relationship that looks backwards to the antecedent person. But seed looks forward. The essence of a seed is a seed contains what is necessary to reproduce the life of what it is a seed of. And so the seed of Abraham are those who are reproducing the life of Abraham.

What does the life of Abraham consist of with respect to the Lord? Abraham believed God. That is, Abraham trusted God for what He promised, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.

How to be in a right relationship with God? Trust Him for what He promises. Trust Him to fulfill the promises. Trust Him for His calling to let Him transform our lives, to let Him help us out of the mess that we are naturally in, to save us from the consequences. Not just the penalty, but moreover the practice of that which is ungodly, namely sin.

And so He gives help to the seed of Abraham, those who are trusting God at His word. And then it points out that he had to endure temptation. In order to be like us, he had to go through temptation the same as we, but withstand it.

Hebrews 3: **Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus the apostle and high priest of our confession. The apostle, the messenger of good news to us, the high priest, the one who represents us to the one who has sent him.**

**He was faithful to Him who appointed him, as Moses also was in all his house, for he has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. And Jesus is the creator of all things.**

**For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.** And the member of the Godhead who did the creative work is Jesus. That's very clear in Colossians. It's clear in John 1 and other places in Scripture.

**Moses was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later. But Christ as a son over his house, whose house we are.**

House in the sense of household. Two implications of that: He is over the household. He is head of the church. But He is also the son, the steward manager of His house, whose house we are.

If God, by the agency of the Holy Spirit, has come to dwell in us, we are His house. He is living in us. **If we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.**

Now, we need to understand what it means by until the end. This is not a chronological end. This is not an end in time. We have heard this passage mistakenly taught to say that because of simply reading the English and not understanding the implications of the Greek term end.

It's a term that means the goal. It means accomplishment, fulfillment, completion, the endpoint, the objective. And it also then comes to mean the ultimate, the greatest, the last, the supreme.

And this is it: it's to hold firm until the end. What is the end? The end is not something—it's not talking about when I die and go to heaven. It's talking about that I'm holding on to my confidence in God and my hope of His fulfilling His promises if I continue to hope in His fulfilling of the promises to the point of what His objective for me is, for every believer.

And so now, Hebrews quotes from Psalm 95, the part that is omitted from every church liturgy that Erica and I know of that include the affirmation portion of Psalm 95, which is wonderful. And we're not opposed to that. And it's perfectly appropriate that it's included.

The Lord is the great King above all gods, in His hand is the earth. And then that we're His sheep and the sheep of His hand that the great King has taken. It talks about His attributes.

Sometimes it's just the invitation to join together in worship, which is wonderful. But the rest of the message, this calling, doesn't have to be proclaimed every time the affirmation portion is. But if it's not proclaimed, then it gives a wrong impression that all I have to do to be in is come Sunday mornings.

So **Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as when they provoked me as in the day of trial in the wilderness where your fathers tried me by testing me and saw my works for 40 years."**

**"Therefore, I was angry with this generation and said they always go astray in their heart. They do not know my ways. As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest."**

The quotation is a literal verbatim quotation from Psalm 95. But Hebrews does a very interesting thing. It divides, on the other side of the "for 40 years," "they tried me by testing," "they saw my work."

Psalm 95 says, "For 40 years I was angry with this generation." Here it says, "They saw my works for 40 years and therefore I was angry with this generation." Both are true. It's just a matter of which is being emphasized in which time. The emphasis here is they saw 40 years of God demonstrating who He is.

And actually, the 10 strikes against Egypt (we call them plagues, which is not a very good rendering of the Hebrew):

The Lord showed Pharaoh that He is superior to every Egyptian god. There were nine of them. It is not accidental, because there are nine arenas of human life. This is true throughout Scripture. It is evident, though not labeled as such.

The Lord showed Pharaoh everything that could possibly convince him of the Lord's superiority. Pharaoh rejected all of it. "They saw my works for 40 years."

In the wilderness, Numbers recounts 10 tests. The Israelite generation that refused to enter the land failed every test. The same thing as with Pharaoh. They refused to be moved by the demonstration or convinced of the demonstration every time.

And so there's the nine arenas, and then the 10th is judgment. The 10th is, "do we let this go on indefinitely and keep propagating, or do we put an end to it now?" And that was it. They came to that 10th point.

So, **"As I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest."** Now, **"Do not harden your hearts"**. How do you harden your hearts? By saying no to God. We all do it. We all say no to God in many ways.

If you keep saying no to God, first you are talking about the specific thing. Then it tends to become more generic. This is the way we learn things. We check something out, and when it doesn't meet the test, we chalk it up to one instance. But we check it out again with other similar things, and it doesn't check out again.

The more it doesn't check out, the less interested we are in looking at the specifics, and more we start to make a general categorical conclusion that this is no good. And it's natural to do that with God. The flesh is determined to fight God off. And so what happens is we become more and more resistant to input from God and more and more settled in our determination that no, and that there's no good news. Why should I bother to keep going to what doesn't come through?

And remember, in the wilderness, Massah and Meribah—strife and quarrel. That's what Moses named those two locations, strife and quarrel, because that's what happened there. They strived against God and they quarreled with Him.

What was the issue there? This isn't turning out the way I thought it would. This is saying "I don't like this. This is not what I signed up for."

Tragically, that is exactly what causes people to abandon their marriage vows and pursue divorce. The traditional vows include: for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness or in health, as long as we both shall live. Wonderful. Many don't include them, but even some who do, when it comes to the point where they become hardened against forgiving and accepting and being patient with their spouse, and even if you call them back and say, but you pledged, for better or for worse.

And so what now? Well, I didn't mean this.

The essence of the marriage vow is marriage is supposed to express God's love in relationship between two people. God's love consists of a unilateral commitment on His part—never to abandon, never to fail, no matter what. We are called each to make that unilateral commitment to the other, not conditional, totally unconditional commitment.

Naturally impossible to keep, but not impossible by the power of the Holy Spirit and with the guidance of God's word.

This is a word of comfort: despair is natural. It's a characteristic of the flesh and giving up. This is not condemning people who sadly give up on their marriage. So we have no intention of putting them down. But this section is actually really helpful in counseling.

Because we will, both in our own lives, and we'll encounter it many times where people aren't hearing the Lord anymore. "I feel distant. I can't see, I'm not as close as I used to be. I can't seem to hear Him anymore". And the question is, and God hasn't moved. I don't like reading the Bible. I used to just want to read it all the time. Then I found that I read it less and less and I'm hardly reading it now. It just doesn't seem to speak to me anymore.

We found that it's really helpful for all of us to see that there are times like the nation of Israel where we have certain expectations of what God will do if He is good. And it doesn't happen. We start quietly, even without realizing it, to question whether we can really trust God or not. I didn't think it was going to be this way. The nation of Israel came forth, delivered from slavery. They were going to the promised land. They didn't expect what the Lord planned with one year in the wilderness, getting to know His faithfulness, His care, His provision. He provided water, food. He protected them. They were attacked militarily. He protected them. He provided for them in spite of the fact that there was no natural provision.

So they could not say, "Well, okay, so there's plenty of stuff along the way. So why do you say it's God?" It had to be God. There was no physical, natural possibility. They didn't expect that. It could have taken 10 days to get straight to the promised land. And I'm sure that's what they expected. But the Lord knew they needed, His plan was not to take them in 10 days, but to spend a year.

They needed to learn. Basically a honeymoon year with them. They needed to learn who He was and that He was trustworthy because it would take strong trust in Him to enter in and stay close. So that He could give all the blessings that He longed to give. So that when they got into the promised land, they wouldn't just depend on it. They would continue to depend on the Lord.

What we have found is that oftentimes because we don't expect the process, we start getting disappointed with the Lord. I didn't realize it was going to be like this. I didn't realize I would go through health issues or trouble at work or trouble in a marriage or a family. And where's God? If He's good, why would He allow this to happen?

That starts building hardness because we start developing a callous to hearing Him. I'm not sure He's good. We start looking elsewhere to try to make life happen. We hear Him less and less. All of us do this to a degree. This is actually very helpful to see that those times when things don't go the way we expect, instead of letting that little bit of hardness keep growing and growing, or maybe a major aspect of hardness, instead, to thank Him that He is still here.

I have two choices. I can either let distrust grow because He's not fulfilling my expectations. He's got something else He's doing. And I didn't sign up for that. What He's often doing is showing us our need for trust. Our need for growth, which is needed before the goodness that we're longing for.

I want a happy marriage. It's going to take a lot of personal growth on both of our parts to get there. That's what the Lord is intent on doing so that we each are transformed so that we bring the character of God to each other and learn to love as He loves. But it takes a lot of hard growth.

Jesus talks about in John 15 in His prayer for all of us, that they would be perfected in unity. Unity doesn't just happen between human beings. It takes a lot of growth, a lot of perfecting, a lot of maturing to be able to receive and enter into and participate in those blessings the Lord wants to give and we want. I want the blessing. I just don't want the process. So I can either say, thank you, Lord. This is bigger than I am, but it's not bigger than You. Teach me how to grow. Teach me how to go with You in this. Or I can start saying, I didn't want this. I feel disappointed. I feel let down. I feel gypped. And then we hear Him less and less.

We've had people who've come to us who aren't reading the Word, feel far from God, and we will ask them at times, was there something the Lord was saying through His Word that you didn't want to hear? When you were preaching, when you were reading the Word and you were comfortably reading the Word, was there some particular theme that seemed to come up again and again, and particularly something that you weren't terribly interested in?

Almost always, with practically no time to think, they can tell us what it was. What was happening was God was trying to speak to them about the issue that had bubble-sorted up to the top of God's priorities on His punch list for them. And they didn't like it.

"I'll go to church, I'll do all of that, but don't you touch my sex life." Or my porn habit. Or trying to get notoriety from other people. Worship, basically, from other people. Or some sort of thing to do with career.

We have counseled people who were deeply depressed, even suicidally depressed, where this was the question. What was it? Not getting the grades to get into the graduate school that they'd set their heart on. Or something like sex life or having or being willing to love a spouse sacrificially when my spouse is not acting the way I would like my spouse to act.

And then if they'll go to the Lord and change their goal from what they have in mind to what the Lord has for them. The best way to do that is, Lord, and this is especially true when you're choosing between a couple of alternatives, but often this is not that way. The real issue is,
"Lord, Your will, whatever it is.
Whatever You know is best.
Not what I think is best.
No matter how convinced I may be that what I think is best is.
What You declare is best is in fact best.
And You know as I don't and I cannot.
Apart from You."

We have seen people who were seriously and suicidally depressed turn in a single counseling session. Now, that doesn't always happen. And that's not necessarily to be expected. But we have seen that.

Of course, the depression and all the battling and so forth. A person turns, but then is exhausted, etc. So it's not just comes out leaping and turning cartwheels for joy and just full of life and excitement but definitely peace, definitely coming to rest because what they have given up is fighting God, fighting to make their dream happen. We’ve had many pre-med students who have their heart set on being a doctor, but their grades don’t look very hopeful for getting into medical school. And it's easy to plunge into deep depression at that point. What they’ve been shooting for all their lives isn’t going to happen. And they feel like a failure. They feel like God has let them down. They prayed and prayed and prayed, and they still didn’t get the grades.

And then we've seen where if they are willing to say, "Lord, You have gifted me. You have a special calling," we take them to Psalm 139, where the Lord is forming them in the womb—what they get from nature and nurture from their parents and their families and so on. And also, once they come to the Lord, Ephesians 2:10: "For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus [handcrafted by Him] for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them."

"Lord, You don’t make junk. You have made me just right. You have gifted me just right for Your calling in my life, and I thought it was medicine, but I’m finding out it’s not. So, Lord, I present myself to You for what Your calling and gifting is for."

We’ve seen people come forth from depression and then enter into the adventure of asking, seeking, knocking, and finding out what His call is. And then they are so thankful down the road that it wasn’t medicine, that there was actually time in their life for marriage and a family and much more than would have been possible if they were a high-class doctor.

We get these expectations of what God will do if He’s good. Then we get disappointed and start hardening against Him, trying to make life happen our way. And that doesn’t work. And we cease hearing Him.

What a key is here that you can think about from this Psalm: What can you do when you find yourself at that point, or when you find you’re helping someone who isn’t hearing the Lord anymore, where there’s a hardness, a disappointment with God that's being built up, and a distrust because He isn’t doing what they expected? And there's more process and growth involved than they thought.

And there's the key. Though they saw My works for 40 years, they didn’t trust. To look right at the moment where I may be in my life, I can’t see where it’s going. All I see is the hard part. But if I look back, where have I seen God’s goodness in the past, even in very hard situations? Where have I seen God’s goodness in the lives of others? And that's where it's important not to get isolated. We need to be with other believers so that when we can't see God ourselves, we can see the Lord over their shoulders and hear of His faithfulness. And hear how He has worked. That encourages us to trust also and to open our hand to welcome what He has.

Old Testament biographies are wonderful because we see a whole life and the choices that are made, and how God has worked in that life, both with good choices and bad choices. We get to see God's trustworthiness and His goodness. It is that that gives us the basis to start trusting again, but with a deeper view of what He is about.

He doesn't want to just deliver the promised land, the goodies, the good circumstances. He wants to transform us and have us be part of it. None of us expect how much is needed and the process it will take. So learning to welcome that and go with it and to keep softening my ears so that I'm responsive to the Lord instead of building up those calluses—that's the issue here.

Today, if you hear His voice... there are two alternatives:
1. to respond with hardness (to resist it), or
2. to respond to it.

Now, unfortunately, in English we see the word disobedient. In both cases we have the same English word, but two different Greek terms, two different kinds of disobedience.

I mentioned earlier that it was with the law; it was talking about disobedience in practice. But this is a different kind of disobedient.

At the end of Hebrews 3:18-19: **"Who did He swear they should not enter His rest but those who were disobedient? So we see they were not able to enter because of unbelief."**

And you say, what? Because the English doesn't tell us the primary nuances of this. This is a different kind of disobedient. This is not just disobedient in practice. This is unpersuaded. This is not persuaded to be obedient.

We see they're not able to enter because of unbelief. Well, that term of disobedience is "disobedience because I was not convinced". I did not decide that it was my will to obey. They were not able to enter because of unbelief.

This belief, or faith, is being persuaded.

The root term in the Greek that's used in the Bible for belief, pistis, comes from peithō, which is to be convinced, to be persuaded, actually to be persuaded, sort of the same thing.

So when you hear God's word, are you persuaded by it? **"Or lest any would be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."** We had two things. We had just the hardness against what God's saying because I don't think I like it. But it talks about being hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

It's because of thinking we've got a better offer—that some form of something that is not God's will appears to us to have more promise of giving us what we're looking for than what God is calling us to.

We will pick up with that next week and run that out further. We will get into Hebrews 4 and much more of what it means to enter God's rest and how to do that.

We'll pick up next week with a bit of a capsule summary, reiteration where we wound up this week, and continue on.

Now we get really practical.

Let's pray, and then we get to pull it all together next week.

> Lord, thank you that you do speak, and thank you that you've spoken since the beginning of time directly through Jesus as well as through the prophets.
>
> Thank you that you communicate yourself, and you communicate what enables us as human beings, your creation, to relate well together, to thrive, and it's all in relationship with you, not us separately.
>
> Lord, please lead us back. There's a lot of material we looked at. May we see you, may we hear you, and Lord, lead us forward in looking ahead. What do you mean, Lord, by entering your rest that's still deeply available for all of us, much more than we've walked in so far? And may we be alert to where we've been building up calluses to hearing you because we didn't like what you did or what you're saying, or you didn't fit our expectations.
>
> Thank you that you are always working much more on multi-levels than we know our need for and working to bless others as well as us.
>
> We ask to trust you for that rather than just determine that if you're good, you'll fulfill my expectations.
>
> Lord, set us free to walk with you with trust and to be powerfully part of your work in this world and to give you joy and be part of your work to bring deliverance to others.
>
> Thank you, Lord, in your name. Amen.
