> Oh Lord, we are so thankful to be Yours. Thank You that everyone here is part of Your family, the family of God, because of Your mercy in sending Jesus Your Son to take our place. Thank You. that Your welcome is to every single person who’s ever lived and that You have died to give us a fresh start and fill us with Your own life by the Holy Spirit, to Your character—beautiful, strong character of righteousness, of being aligned with You, filled with You.

> And we’re so thankful, Lord, to be part of Your family forever. Thank You that You promise to grow us up, all of us, because we all need it. and we all stumble in many ways. Thank You that Your grace is more than sufficient and Your life within, and that You promise to complete what You’ve begun. Faithful are You who’ve called us, and You also will bring it to pass.

> And Lord, thank You for each one here. Thank You that You know each one intimately and, knowing everything, You love us. Thank You for the privilege of getting to study Your Word openly. We ask that You will preserve that freedom—the freedom to study Your Word and proclaim You and Your Word to all ages.” We ask, Lord, to learn tonight, open our ears to hear You. And may we be tremendously encouraged and given vision, each of us, for Your service and for our own lives. Thank You that You invite us to be partners with You in Your work in a broken and hurting world. We are so thankful for that privilege and that honor.

> You are growing us up at the same time. Thank You, Lord, for speaking tonight to each one of us. May You use it for equipping and not just for more head knowledge. Thank You for the joy of active fellowship and partnership with You and with one another.

> In Your name, amen.
> Amen.


As you know from the little announcement that we sent out, we’re in another foundation stone passage. This passage that we’re in tonight has been a foundation stone and given vision for me in particular, and then for us, and has led to so much ministry in so many places. There are relatively few verses.

In future weeks, we’ll be getting into many more verses. This, like last week, is a short passage but very pithy in terms of the content and the practical import for our lives and for our ministries. We’re praying that our ears will be open to the Lord to learn, not just in our heads more good Bible knowledge, but to walk this out and be equipped through it to partner much better and more sensitively with the Lord as all of us here are serving Him in the places and relationships where He has called us.

As we will be looking at, you will run across many people who class themselves in need of what is being described here. So we’ll read the passage. I’ll say a little bit more, and then we’ll dig in.

We’re in Isaiah 50, starting in verse 4:

"The Lord God has given me the tongue of disciples, that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens morning by morning. He awakens my ear to listen as a disciple. The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not disobedient, nor did I turn back. I give my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pluck out the beard. I did not cover my face from humiliation and spitting."

I think you need to read one more in the next verse:

"For the Lord God helps me."

And of course it goes on from there. So you will meet many weary ones throughout your life. Let me finish verse 7:

"The Lord God helps me; therefore I am not disgraced. Therefore I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed."

This passage has a lot of practical insights packed into it. You will encounter people throughout your life who are weary for many reasons. I don’t need to ask any of you. I know that every one of you has encountered deep weariness in your life at various times. This is a broken world, and life includes this. What the Lord is doing here is He is alerting us that there is infinite opportunity to speak to people whose ears are now open. Jesus kept saying, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." If someone's ears are not open, you can talk complete 100% truth as Jesus did, and most people won't hear it and may in fact fight it and reject it and fight us at the same time.

Throughout your life, you will encounter people who, through their own choices, through the choices of others, through hard circumstances, their ears are now open. They're weary. They're out of their own resources. They have lost hope and purpose. And you, as we equip ourselves the Lord's way, then we're in a position where the Lord Himself will start bringing those people to us if we're alert first to His welcome, His equipping, and then our listening for those nudges to come alongside those people.

I will give examples later, but it can happen anywhere. It's happened on street corners. It's happened in grocery stores, on campus, with all ages, in extended family gatherings.

As you welcome the Lord's equipping, He will start bringing you those opportunities. There is so much joy and honor in getting to be part of the Lord's work to lift someone up when they have lost hope.

There is much to learn from this passage. Let's dig in.

The Lord God has given me the tongue of disciples that I may know how to sustain the weary one with a word. We have here the source, the means, and the objective and expected benefit.

As Erica was just saying, everyone is weary in various ways, much of the time. Cumulatively, as we get older, we start to recognize that, you know, how are you today? Tired? Welcome to the new normal. We've realized that tired is the new normal. Our weakness, but God's strength. We're in the front row seat to trust Him for it and receive it and walk in it. But tired, naturally, is the new normal.

It was interesting last night as we asked, what kind of weariness do people experience? There is a broad range. So what categories do you think of when you talk about what makes people weary? What makes you weary at times?

Nancy.

Wrestling with a decision.

Yes.

Soojin?

So I think in my mom, my group of mom friends, there's weariness in parenting an adult child, especially when there's mental illness involved and there's nothing that the parent can do once they turn 18 and they decide to do whatever they want with their treatment. So there's weariness in parenting.

Yes.

It's a long, long call ministry, sacrificial ministry.

For me, it's caring for aging parents, specifically our two moms, both of whom have varying degrees of dementia. So that's a pretty heavy burden at times.

Yes. I came to regard caring for aging parents as a burdensome privilege. I would not miss the last year or two of my father's life and what I was able to do, what the Lord did through me, but it is a wonderful privilege and I am so glad I did. And that's what I carry forward. But at the time, I can remember well how burdensome it was at times.

We took all seven of our parents through to the end, so we know what you're talking about—the whole range, the whole spectrum from rabid unbelievers, spitting unbelievers, very, very mature believers.

By the way, it's never too late to really start growing in the Lord. My mother had been a God-fearing woman for decades and decades but she hadn't had good Bible teaching and she didn't come to know Jesus personally until she was in her late 60s. In the next 30 years, you have never seen anyone grow so fast. Never too late.

Steve got to lead his father to the Lord at almost 95, two months before he died. You never give up. You keep praying. You keep serving. Then the Lord can use you. Never assume, unless someone has told you, that you know what's holding somebody back from the Lord. It can be extremely surprising.

That must have been so joyous for you to see, like Uncle Jim and the rest of the family.

Oh, yes. Really awesome. It enabled him to go when the time came in peace. Not in fear.

All of us were around his bed at the skilled nursing up in San Francisco on a foggy day. We all felt led to read from John 14.

It was Easter, wasn't it?

I think it was.

Yes, it was Easter. To read that Jesus says, "Do not fear because I have gone before you and I am preparing a place and I will come and I will receive you to myself that where I am you may be always."

And as Steve was reading those... I had been reading chapters from John to him ever since he had welcomed Jesus in and I was reading from the text. And as he read, a shaft of sunlight came through the window and was on Steve's father's face. He was smiling, listening to the very focused light right on his face.

When when Steve finished reading, the light withdrew and Steve's father was gone. It was just the Lord's presence was so clear and He Himself had come to receive His own home.

Those times are so hard, but at the same time, there's so much joy as we're in way over our heads and get to see the Lord at work and be part of it. A lasting memory of the Lord's powerful work and the gift of being part of it.

We're praying for you, Frank, with much appreciation for what you're doing. Thank you for sharing. And Soojin, you've just been through all this.

In this text, who gives us the tongue of disciples? It is the Lord Himself. The Lord God has given me the tongue of disciples. And disciple means learner. So I have the tongue, the words from one who has been learning from Jesus Himself. It's the Lord God who has given me the capacity to do that.

How does it come? We get to develop it, but the capacity is there—the tongue of disciples. How does one develop the tongue of a disciple? A disciple is a learner. How can you speak as a learner?

You speak what is told to you because in the following verse it says, "He awakens me morning by morning; he awakens my ear to listen, and then he opens my ear." It is one thing to listen, and it's another thing for the Lord to open your ear to hear truths. You gain the tongue of a learner by learning.

You can speak as one who has learned, and you can speak what you have learned, which does not merely mean what you have learned about.

I mentioned the students last night, my best professors in graduate school. They were not just the ones who understood the theory of whichever aspect of business they were teaching, but who had lived it and worked it out in the workplace. They knew what they were talking about.

We go back to Ezra, where we were last week. Ezra set his heart. He committed his objectives to seeking the law of the Lord, to studying God's word, where it explains especially the absolutes of life that apply all the time to everyone. Of course, then there are ones that apply to specific things. But a law, as I mentioned last week, is something to which there are no exceptions.

Ezra was concerned to learn, not just the absolutes of life, but to learn the wisdom for life from the Lord, from His word, to do it, to seek it, to do it. We cannot leapfrog over that step.

People go to schools, graduate schools, to learn how to counsel people in whatever capacity—as therapists or whatever. But no matter how much you know the theory, you really know for real what you have lived.

Wanting to learn to do biblical counseling means recognizing that the wisdom for life is in God's written word. But you cannot just study it to teach others. You have to apply it yourself.

Then you not only get to understand it for real, but you also find out where your theoretical understanding is and is not correct.

What is the learning process? He really outlines that. How do I get equipped?

It says, the Lord Himself "awakens me morning by morning." For those of us who are older, we know that He wakes us up earlier. The more you progress in life, the tireder you are and the earlier the Lord wakes you up. The harder it is to get to sleep in the first place.

I told young folks, sleep in while you can, because that capacity will not last. It doesn't really last past grade school or junior high because they pile on so much work.

Stanford's William DeMint is considered the academic guru of sleep. His research shows that when you're college age, you need 10 hours of sleep a night. A very high percentage of Stanford students never get more than half of that. The campus is hopping at 1 a.m. We've been there.

They probably learn better and learn more if they spend more time sleeping and less time reading and studying, not to mention other activities.

The point here is the Lord God opens my—He awakens me. It is wonderful to know that, to wake up, to meet with Him. He Himself is here. He promises, "I am with you always," just as much as any one of us are. He is right here, and I get to wake up to Him.

If you really want to learn that by a wonderful learning experience, backpack into the Sierras when it's getting really cold at night. The Lord will awaken you each morning by cooking you out of your sleeping bag. It's a wonderful way to wake up.

I was thinking of how you wake up now. I love how you wake up now, greeting the Lord. I often wake up and look to the Lord and say, "Good morning, Jesus. Thank you for loving. I love you. Thank you for loving me. And Father, thank you for loving me. Let's do the day together."

It is a wonderful way to start the day acknowledging and welcoming His presence before you even get your toes out of bed. Because He is here. He Himself awakens me.

This "awakens" is more than what we think of as awaken. It is arouse. Stir up. It is not from the jangling of an alarm clock or the soothing annoyance of the music station that you set your clock to tune on. Or the traffic that gets going outside our door at 5:30 a.m.

This arousing is awakening, a calling, an eagerness for action that comes from within, not as imposed. It is not by depriving one of sleep who would like to sleep another hour or two.

This is the Lord calling us to action, calling us to life with Him. Our sister-in-law, who is now home with the Lord, delightful, was in a monastery in Germany. She was a Catholic nun. Those 10 sisters had just wonderful life. They really loved Jesus. She did a lot of counseling. She counseled priests, pastors, various people who were burned out and there for R&R.

Numerous times she would hear someone in full-time vocational ministry saying, "I can't spend time in the Scriptures. I'd love to, but I don't have the time." She told one priest, and various others, "Make the time." She told one of them, "Get your behind out of bed well before your parishioners get up and spend time with the Lord." And the thing is, actually, time spent with the Lord before going out to the activities of the day actually will get you started on your activities of the day more refreshed than if you got more sleep. It's really true. I've had various conversations with priests and pastors from all sorts of denominations who've said the same thing: "I'm too busy. I don't even get time in the word myself."

Especially catching a vision of what the Lord is showing us in the word of the wisdom for all those human issues that they're counseling all the time. That's like preparing to run a marathon by starving yourself for a month. And it's so easy. There is never time given to us, and there is active spiritual warfare always against being in the word.

You can even get yourself sat down and then where is your mind? Elsewhere. Even to get sat down can be a real chore. I used to think of myself as at times like a dog circling 10 times of, "Oh, I'll get the laundry going and oh, I'll get this going and that and that and that." Then finally, sit down, and then my mind is elsewhere. There's all the attack.

Our last dog, Regal, some of you know him, who lived to love, literally. That's amazing. I didn't realize he went around doing the laundry and everything else. Well, he didn't. I did. He was very talented. I was the silly dog.

Joking aside, the serious thing about that is don't let your mind fill up with anything else until you have filled up adequately with the Lord. Don't read the paper, turn on the computer, check your emails, get on the cell phone. We're really establishing not as rules. If you establish it as a rule, your flesh will want to rebel. But just wisdom.

Where's life? Who do I want to hear? What do I want to fill up with before my mind is crammed with more things? We wake up with plenty already on our minds. It has been so helpful to see this passage says the Lord Himself awakens me, arouses me with really a call: "Come, let's spend time together. Come fill up with me. Come fill up with my messages so that you're ready to partner with me today."

Start the day from a healthy perspective. Start from the Lord's perspective. We see this in Jesus' ministry. Mark 1 describes that incredible first day of ministry. Then what? In the morning, the disciples are looking all over for Him. Why? They don't know where He is because He got up long before they did.

They found Him in—I chuckle at the typical translation—in a lonely place. That sounds like a place where you would be very unhappy. It's an isolated place. Jesus Himself, the only perfect human being who ever lived a human life on earth, and who was God Himself incarnate, needed time in isolation from everyone else with His heavenly Father before starting every day. If Jesus needed it, I certainly do. And a good indicator of the importance of that time and the perspective that comes out of it is Mark 1. The disciples are looking for Him. They say, "Your ministry to people yesterday was so powerful that the entire town has turned out wanting more of the same, and people who didn't participate yesterday now wanting to be part."

What does Jesus say? "Let's go somewhere else." What? By conferring with the Father, He learned that the program was not to do saturation ministry in any one location, but to plant seeds in many locations. And so all these people are lined up and He says, "Let's go somewhere else."

This is Mark 1:35-39. It is really His summit meeting with the Father, His meeting with the Father to get the perspective from above before He is ready to know how to handle the zillion opportunities and pressures of the day. He could have easily opened the Jesus healing clinic, healing and teaching center right there where He was, but He knew from that summit meeting with the Father, the backed off perspective of the overall calling where He says, "Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby in order that I may preach there also, for that is what I came out for." He had that summit meeting with the Father, reviewed what the overall purpose is, and then was ready to act on it when everyone was pressuring Him to stay. Ministry opportunities were right in front of Him. So if He needed that, we certainly do.

It's very encouraging to hear that He not only arouses me, but He arouses my ear to listen as a learner. Why would He need to do that? Again, I love the physical picture. I've got the tongue of a disciple, the words, but He arouses my ear so that I can listen as a learner.

How does anything come out of the mouth with the aid of the tongue? It has to come in through the ear first. We do not have the ability to minister to people innately. We have it to the degree that we have received it from the Lord. We are created to be like God and to manage the prayers of life the way God does, but we are not created to be God. The wisdom for life needs to be received by each individual from God.

There is another part of Scripture that talks about the tongue, and it is not complimentary. What comes naturally is from James 3:5-6 "So also the tongue is a small part of the body, and yet it boasts of great things. Behold how great a forest is set aflame by such a small flame." We are seeing examples of this internationally right now and nationally.

The tongue is a fire, the very world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members as that which defiles the entire body and sets on fire the course of our life and is set on fire by hell. With it, we bless our God and Father and we curse the people in our lives—people who are incarnations of His image. Yeah. And so, naturally, the tongue is not good news. We voice that which is completely self-motivated. But here we're getting to learn how to use our words, whether it's expressed verbally or in our bodies, but here it's words. We get to learn by learning from the one who created it.

And again, you think of the Lord answering Moses at the burning bush. He's been commissioned to go free his people, go back to Egypt, and he's saying, "I've never been good at speaking, Lord." And the Lord's answer: "Who made man's mouth? I will give you the words." And that's what we need. We need His words.

It says we're told the Holy Spirit brings to our remembrance what Jesus says, but we can't remember if we haven't been in it. He doesn't have much to access. And so how do we do this? The two parts to that: hearing it and considering it worth remembering.

That's the real key to learning—not just being exposed, but welcoming it, seeing it as important. Not merely listening for what will speak to my immediate concern, but to have eager ears to hear that which, though I may not need it now, and I may not have a sense of how I will need it or use it, recognizes that I will, I do need it, and I will have opportunities.

But I won't necessarily, as I get into the situation where I need to know this and act on it, be in a position where somebody is standing there telling it to me right then. It's very important. It's being prepared because we don't know. Even in full-time pastoral and counseling ministry, you don't know what's going to walk in the door, what concern, what question.

The better you're prepared, the more you know Scripture, the better equipped you'll be to respond when whatever it is comes up.

Steve described last night how even as a little boy, he just wanted to learn everything because even if he wasn't going to use it now, he was sure if he got to know it, he could use it later. That's the attitude to go into listening to the Lord with His word.

I may not know the immediate application for it right now, but I'm learning for myself for the future, and I'm learning for others. And so I want to go in saying, "These are the words of life." I want to learn as much as I can, not just in my head, but in order to walk it out.

As I do that, the Lord will bring people who need to hear what I've been learning. I've experienced that frequently. We'll get into more of that.

It's the typical phenomenon, Sunday morning. Many, probably most of the people listening to the message from the word are not really hearing it because they've got concerns, immediate concerns, and they don't sense that it's speaking to them. It's not what they think they want to hear or need to hear now. And, of course, there are all the distractions to stop and think. When you were in church last Sunday or a couple of weeks ago, during the message, what were you thinking about? What kind of thoughts went through your mind? Did you start itching somewhere and turn your attention to scratching and trying to satisfy it? Was it a time for free time to think of things you don't have time to think of at other times? Everything from grocery lists to trying to remember a phone call you need to make or something you need to do.

In your quiet time, have a slip of paper and a pen on the side somewhere. If something comes up like, "Oh my gosh, I've got to mail that letter tomorrow or there's going to be a big penalty," just make a note, mail XYZ. Then you don't have to think about it again during the time you're spending in the Word, because it'll be right there when you're through.

It is wonderful to know that the Lord Himself is there to awaken my ear. It is easy at times to despair because of all the distractions. But to know the Lord, the powerful God of the universe, is there to enable it.

In James 4 it says "Draw near to God and he will draw near to you." It is often a process, like my talking about circling 10 times. What I have learned, and it would be good to hear your thoughts as well, are practices that we have developed in order to settle and hear Him? As Steve said, we do not get on the computer or the cell phone first. We turn off our phones when we go to bed, and we do not turn them on until after we finish our time with the Lord.

Have this list so that if something comes to mind that, if I don't remember it, there is going to be trouble, just jot down a couple of words and then put it in the Lord's lap for His showing you what to do and His timing. Then you get to refocus on learning from Him. That has been very helpful.

Also, practices that we have done over the years: for years and years, before we even got out of bed, we would read one chapter in the New Testament. Just read. This is not study. Just read and ask the Lord to teach us. That was before any study or teaching, anything more concentrated.

Then at night before going to bed, read a chapter of the Old Testament. Because they are very different lengths, over the years there is a different mix and match between Old and New, and we are being exposed to the whole counsel of God, not just the favorite areas.

And sometimes we'll say, "Well, those were very interesting genealogies, but I'm not sure what to make of it in my life," To be able to thank the Lord that even He knew every one of those people and cared about them. And the interesting thing about that many people will say (quoting from the King James) the "begats". You know, "so and so begat so and so" and so forth. And actually, there is good reason for each of the genealogies, but it's not likely to grab a new believer, somebody who's just starting to read the Bible. In fact, there are plenty of people who started to read the Bible like anything else, you just start on page one, and as soon as they start to get to the begats, they lost interest.

You'll hear that probably numerous times during your life.

But it was amazing to read a while ago about a primitive tribe that was so pleased to get the Bible, and probably Wycliffe translators were in there to learn their language and give them a written language and then give them the Bible, starting with the New Testament in their own language.

The thing that gripped this tribe of people was the genealogies. This was the most important, the most exciting news message that they'd ever received.

Why? Because we have puzzled and puzzled over the mystery: Where did we come from? And now we know.

Erica was talking about our routine, our current routine. Our routines are varied, but we've had a regular Bible reading routine all along.

Our current routine, and we do it with breakfast every morning, is first we read whatever's next in the Old Testament, and then we read the next thing in a cycle of the Gospels and Acts. Then we read whatever's next in the cycle of the Epistles.

The Gospels and Acts is about half the New Testament. The wonderful thing is, with these three liturgies each going through its own cycle, it is so amazing how many times we will say, "Wow, all three readings this morning, we're all talking about the same topic."

It happens again and again. These are passages we would never have thought of in conjunction with each other. But the important things come up multiple times in Scripture.

It has been helpful in looking at this passage to ask, what makes me deaf?

First, may I come back to a comment about the excitement to get to know the Word? I have got to admit, there have been seasons in my life when it's kind of been a bit in the background. Then I'd come back to it.

But I was blessed. The Lord has given me the tongue of disciples. I was blessed by the Lord as a little child. I got really excited about the Bible when I was three or four. I just couldn't hear enough Bible. I couldn't learn enough about the Bible.

The Sunday school department in the church I went to was really wonderful because my mother had been brought up in a church background. It was Roman Catholic. Her parents were sincere Catholics, and she learned the importance of prayer, which is one thing the Catholic Church really teaches well. She knew that the answer, if you’re going to find it anywhere, had to be in the Bible. When it was time for them and their friends or contemporaries to send their children to Sunday school, instead of going to the one that most of their friends were sending their children to, she searched around and found a little church where the Sunday school program was nothing but Bible. The pastor’s wife managed the Sunday school and taught the preschoolers. That’s where I encountered the Lord.

The most exciting thing I’d ever heard—this may be my earliest memory—was when she told us that you can pray anywhere, anytime, about anything, and God will hear you. I think it was that afternoon I remember being out in the backyard, swinging on the swing. It was a beautiful day, and I just thanked God for the beautiful day. I knew He was right there with me. It was very clear, and I wanted Him there always.

When I was still five years old, the Sunday school department gave me a Bible. They had never given a Bible to a child that young before because they were afraid it would just get thrown on a shelf and become just a familiar nothing and wouldn’t get read. But I was so hungry for the word that they decided to do this. I read it and read it, read it and read it.

So I know the eagerness and the waking up eager to get into the Bible. Not that I did that all the time by any means, but I learned this. I had a lot of things I had to learn that would have been very helpful for ministry because I didn’t go the route that a lot of the people I was ministering to had gone. But I think this is because the Lord was starting when I was very little in calling me into ministry. It was decades before it really happened.

Anyway, the open ear is where we are now, I think. Is the ear naturally open to the word of God? It is not. What makes us deaf? Our flesh. Ourselves.

Now, there are many causes. What did God create us to be? Rulers on the earth over creation. Yes. But He commissioned us to do—who did He make us to be? In His image. Yes, living representations of Himself. So He’s made us to be living expressions of His nature, His life, and to manage things the way He does, which we have to learn to do.

Most of us have the innate sense from when we’re very little, “I’m born to rule.” And it’s true. We are. But not in that individualistic, independent, “I can do it, it just comes automatically” way. We have to learn that that doesn’t really work. It doesn’t really succeed, at least not at good things. We have to discover that we need more than just who we are by creation. We need a living relationship with the One who made us to represent it.

A lot of the ears that are not open ask, “Why should I? Why should I want this? I don’t need it. I’m doing just fine.” If you ask me, I’m doing great. If you ask other people, you might get some different answers about how I’m doing, especially those close to me. We have to discover for ourselves that there’s a lot that we need to learn. I think another hindrance to hearing is that we have a tendency to talk first. I think that comes more from whether it’s pridefulness or something about the self, getting your word out. It’s somewhat cultural too. The American tradition is to be bold and speak out, freedom and freedom of speech and all that. We’re constantly fighting against that because here, in Scripture, it says to be slow to speak and quick to listen. It’s difficult sometimes to fight through that.

Our need to—can be so aware of our need that that’s the only thing that our ears are open to at the moment.

> In Ecclesiastes, it says that if you are truly in the presence of the Lord, and then you know You are God in heaven and here am I on earth, if we are in that state of mind, then really what can we say? "Let my words be few."

You’re speechless.

> I just think that image, why is it that I'm praying my guts out to God? Is it really because I'm in His presence? Or is it because it's my anxieties or my worries that are driving my prayer instead of my honoring God? He knows I have these worries, but I don't have to give them all the details over and over and over again.

A lot of people get deeply into journaling, and it's often journaling how I feel, how unfair it is. It's journaling the flesh endlessly, and you end up feeling worse rather than better.

We recommend, if you're going to journal, make it pithy. Put a date. List the need that you're praying about. Then any Scripture that comes to mind, then any Scripture that comes to mind later. And then as you hear the answer, what it was and the date. Then you've got a log of God speaking and a log of His answering specific prayers that you can go back to when you're on to the next big one of, I don't know what to do, but God. I can even look back and say, but He was so faithful here and here and here. He spoke and He acted, and I can trust Him for this big one where I'm in over my head.

It can be a kind of a book of remembrance that strengthens you rather than burying you in the flesh, grumbling and feeling so sorry for itself, which our flesh can do easily. Our recommendation is that if you're going to journal, that can be actually a real adjunct to faith for the next time that I'm going through a hard thing that I know I'm in over my head.

> I wanted to add something. In the Gospels, it says, "He who has ears to hear, let him listen." We all can hear, but it doesn't mean we actually comprehend it. He awakens our ear. Not everybody who hears what Jesus is saying is listening. Because He says, "He who has ears to hear, let him listen." He opens our ears and our hearts to understand what He's trying to say. Absolutely, Eileen.

Hearing, they may not hear. Seeing, they may not see. Jesus talks about the blind and the deaf. Those who can look right at the real thing and not recognize it for what it is. And why is that? Our flesh keeps us from hearing our sin.

Who are your heroes? Swaggering people who go around crushing skulls, people who make a whole lot of money, and even if they're not cheating other people to do it, it's all about me. It's all about self.

John Rockefeller, when he was still in his Robert Barron season, by the way, when he was 30 years old, every major newspaper in the country had his obituary ready to print because he was a wizened aged old man at 30. Then he turned to the Lord, the transformation, and instead of his ethic, when he was asked how much money is enough, his regular reply was just one more dollar. Never enough.

There have been great benefits from the Rockefeller Foundation using for beneficial ends the fortune that was amassed by ruining other people. And you know, who is your hero? If your hero is something that is very ungodly, when you see the real thing you don't recognize it as life.

What is the big reason people stray from God? What are they afraid He wants to do? That the result will be less life or that it will turn out worse than doing it my way.

Another good one is that you'll send them to like some third world country. I'm going to have to be a missionary. A single missionary. It's a place I don't want to be at. What are people afraid that God wants to do? Who wants to control them and mess up their life?

You've heard me tell probably about Paul Little. And Paul means small. He was neither small nor little. But it was wonderful when he dramatized that Urbana 73. He said, people imagine that God is this big ogre up in heaven, leaning over the balcony rail of life, looking for someone who's having fun so He can shout out, "Cut it out."

People imagine that letting God into your life is going to ruin it. First of all, it's going to take away your control, which is an illusion, that He's going to start running your life and make you miserable. So people are afraid to hear about God because they don't think that hearing about God or even hearing God would be good news. Only bad news, because they're so used to thinking of things that are ungodly as where life really is.

Just in the text, I think there's some clear reasons why we tend to be deaf. One is in areas of weariness, where we're weary, where what we've been called to is long run, a long haul, like caring for parents with dementia. And it's hard. It's sacrificial. And it's easy to just be weary. I know it's what I'm supposed to do. It's a good thing. I'm expressing God. I don't feel like it. And it's so easy. The weariness can end up deafening us. Rather than saying, Lord, I get to serve unto You, and would You please bring much fruit out of this, even when it seems like they are not understanding.

I'll never forget as I was caring for my mom frequently and she was in a skilled nursing facility. A lot of the people had dementia, and they had a little Bible study. Most of them fell asleep during the Bible study.

There was one lady who went around telling everybody, "You've got to come to the Bible study." And she came to the Bible study every week and promptly fell asleep. But they would, at the end, pass the mic for each person to say something if they wanted to.

And one 101-year-old man, I'd never heard say a word, struggled out, "Jesus loves me, and that's enough," and handed the mic to the next person. It was so beautiful. I will never forget that. Such an encouragement out of, you know, at that time of life, as the head nurse said, "Everything hurts. Your whole body aches."

And so for him to have that be his few words of proclamation was absolutely beautiful.

They would divide the whole group in half, and then a lady who was blind would start playing old hymns. You could tell the memories were stirring deep within them, and whichever team came out with the name of the hymn first got a point. You could see them starting to mouth the words because the Lord speaks so deeply through music, and pretty soon somebody could come out with the title or the first line.

And it was just, again, stirring deep memories that were tied with the Lord.

But weariness can make us deaf. Instead of saying, you know, I get to serve unto You, would You please use this? Thank You that this is not for naught. I get to thank You. I have the privilege of expressing You. And would You please use this not only with the recipients, but with those who are watching and praying?

And He does. We've always got a bigger audience that we're influencing than just what we're saying and doing directly. And it's amazing how the Lord will use that.

We had two guys who did a startup company and came up with a brilliant idea. They and their family sacrificed a lot to get it out there. It was very competitive with a top company. The top company bought them, and it's supposedly in order to produce it. But in fact, they would have saved probably actually billions of dollars.

But instead, the company bought them and then shelved it because they didn't want the competition. Well, they didn't want the competition, but also because it would improve the efficiency of their huge multinational corporation so much they would have to lay off tens or hundreds of thousands of employees if they started using this technology.

And so they didn't want to hear it. So they bought it. So then it was theirs and nobody else could do anything with it. And it was easy for these guys and their families who were believers to say, "What was all that sacrifice about? Where was God? How did this happen? We've poured our lives and sacrificed into this."

But the freedom came when they realized, "We did our work unto you, Lord. We did it in your service. We get to thank you for what we did. Our reward is with you," and Colossians 3 says that, "to do your work from the soul unto him with thanksgiving," and that "your reward is with him."

It is not for naught, even though it didn't get produced. The potential it had wasn't realized. Before the Lord, it had high value, and they grew and learned a lot.

They were weary. They had lost hope. They felt like all of their, they poured their lives into was for naught. It was the thorns and thistles that can be so discouraging.

But as they saw, "Who are we doing this for? Our reward is with him." It just raised hope, and they've built forward from there once they thanked Him and really gave it unto Him and asked to learn all that they could from this so that they could serve better in the future. They did and have been able to help others because of it.

It also talks about another factor that makes us deaf, where he says, "I was not disobedient, nor did I turn back."

There are times where we're called to hard things. Gethsemane was not fun. Jesus' natural life did not want to go to the cross. He knew what was ahead every bit and the horror of taking the sin of all the world on Himself, He who knew the horror of it in a way that we don't begin to.

There are times where we're called to hard things, and it's easy to just, I'd rather be deaf. I really don't want to hear that. It has been a helpful practice to ask, what's making me deaf?

As Jesus went ahead, He experienced what it says later, "The Lord God helps me." As He said, "Okay, not my will, but yours be done. It is what I came for. There is no other way. And all these people are worth it, all of us."

For the joy beyond the cross, He despised the shame and went ahead and had His focus on us and on the joy beyond the cross. That opened His ears to hear the Lord and He could move forward in strength instead of in weakness and clinging to what He didn't want to have happen. That is a real key.

I am just going to give a quick example. Some of you have heard this, where I had a chance to live this out a couple of years ago in the hospital with fluid around my heart and lungs. You can die from that. I was in that no man's land where they were running scans, giving injections in my tummy, and all sorts of stuff. My roommate was miserable and vocal all night. I was right next to a noisy nurses station and I couldn't sleep. I just longed to go home and get some sleep and heal. But I was there till they released me, and they couldn't release me till they thought I wasn't going to die.

It was kind of a timeless world. I could have imploded into, I feel so bad. I don't want to be here. At times I've talked about getting my flesh out and looking at it and saying, are we complaining again? All of us can grumble for real reasons. I naturally was miserable, but I could stay there and stay deaf to what the Lord wanted to do.

Steve and I have learned when our bodies break down, we take Jesus to the medical people. We get to care for them while they're caring for us. Most people, when they're in pain, can be pretty nasty to the medical staff.

And I said, thank you, Lord. This wasn't my choice of where I'd like to be, but thank you, Lord. You have put me here and I accept that and welcome it. I ask you to strengthen me and accomplish your purposes. I'm so thankful that I did instead of just imploding into how I felt.

The what turned out to be the last night I was there, the Lord connected me with a beautiful traveling nurse. I had not seen a hairbrush for four days. I looked like a wreck. But she recognized the life of the spirit. She shared with me, "I feel so weary." She used those words. "I'm caring for umpteen zillion patients. I'm running. I get so many complaints and sharp words and nobody seems to understand."

She's from the Bible Belt, not a believer. But she was alone and deeply weary. The Lord led me to say, "well, I know what to do with weary". And I quoted the end of Matthew 11, "come to me all who are weary and heavy laden..."

I like to paraphrase that, "All you who are wiped out and still under the pile".

"Come to me and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you..." It's a double yoke. I get to yoke up with the big guy, which is Jesus, and do this together with him instead of trying to do it myself or just cope or get through.

"Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my double yoke upon you and learn from me. [Again, disciple, learn from me in the midst of this.] For I am gentle and humble in heart..." Gentle is strength under control. It's a term used for a tamed wild horse. It's power, but used for good purpose. Like Jesus, Creator of the universe, who made Himself small so we could understand Him. Gentle and humble of heart. He’s not arrogant. "...and you shall find rest for your souls." For your inner life. That’s where you’re weary. You’ll find rest in the yoke, in the double yoke, with Him, learning from Him. "For my yoke is delightful and my load is light." And so I get to do it with Him.

I was encouraging her. Jesus is here to do this with you as you welcome Him. She was from the Bible Belt. She’d been in churches, but not a believer. She knew she was hearing His words and was just glued. It was the right word at the right time. She was weary. She saw my weirdness, felt free in my care, felt free to share. I could use His words to lift the weary one because I had listened to Him to lift me up and thanked Him.

And then I asked her, "Do you have a Bible?" No, but she was flying home to her state. The next day she could look on her phone. So I gave her key scriptures to read and I prayed for her there right from my hospital bed.

And then she said, "I wish we could give each other a hug." I said, "Why not?" So I jumped out of bed, tubes and all, gave her a great big bear hug and said, "This hug is from God. You know that He meant us to meet."

With tears running down both of our cheeks, she said, "I know, I know." It was one of those divine appointments that made me know even if this whole hospitalization was just about that, it was so worth it.

I started out weary, thanked Him, entrusted myself to Him and made myself available. Then I was right in position to hear that nudge and watch Him open up an amazing opportunity that I think is completely life-changing for her. She knew believers. She was going back to find a good church and determined to go deeper. It was a life changer for her.

If I had stayed imploded in my own misery and not heard the Lord, I would have missed all of that. But I came out just dancing on the inside. Then I was released the next day. I think the Lord’s business with my being there was done. You never know.

Even with the extreme pain I’ve got in my leg right now, people recognize the limp who have pain, and I’ve gotten to pray for ladies right on the big, busy street corner.

As we thank the Lord where we’re weary and learn from Him: How do I handle this? How do I approach this? Thank You for it. Open my ears to hear You.

Key words throughout Scripture: you can look up the key words of weary because there are different scriptures that address answers to different areas that make us weary. It comes up in Hebrews 12. Also "lose heart" is another phrase you can look up, where 2 Corinthians talks about, "we don’t lose heart even though our outer man is decaying. We are getting older and the body’s falling apart because our inner man is being renewed day by day." There are quite a few places where it is mentioned, different causes. You look at what tends to make us weary and what are His answers to that specific thing. Then you're equipping yourself so that the Lord can start bringing people to you who need to hear what you yourself are learning.

I could give you countless examples, but it turns things that make us weary, things that we would never sign up for, into places of training and then places where we can be powerfully used by the Lord. With perfect strangers, but the Lord is in conversation with them. He knows they have ears to hear because of their need.

We've been prepared through our need and going to Him for His answers. Then He will start bringing people to you. The joy is immense.

There is plenty more we can continue on, and we will next week. The next couple of verses are very powerful before we move on to another passage.

> Oh, Lord, thank You so much that You use real life as the setting for training us up. Lord, You called us to be not of the world, but You have not removed us from the world because there is so much where we get to learn in the midst from You and then get to share what You have taught us that lifts up so many.

> Thank You for the lifetime of people that each of us will have opportunity to lift up as they have gotten weary and opened their ears through their own choices and the choices of others and circumstances beyond their control. Life that is bigger than we are.

> Lord, may we come to You when we are weary, instead of running around trying to solve it ourselves and manufacture strength we do not have. May we come to You and learn from You and take the double yoke. "You are the big guy, we are the little guy." May we just look sideways at You and enjoy the company as You lead us in service instead of looking at how long and big the field is to plow.

> Thank You that You give rest to our souls as we are in the midst, as we are welcoming the invitation to meet with You, to learn from You, both the whole counsel of God and the specifics of where we are feeling overwhelmed and do not know what to do. Keep us learning, Lord, and then equipped to partner with You in strategic ways.

> Thank You, Lord God, for each one here in Your name. Amen.
