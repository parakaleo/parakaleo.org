> Oh Lord, thank you so much that your word speaks to us no matter what nation or cultural background or time in history we are. Thank you that you address us through your word overall and personally. You personalize it through your Holy Spirit, and we ask that all of us will hear you tonight, Lord. Thank you for these times together week by week, year by year, and thank you that we get to learn and grow together and pray for one another and see what you do over the long run.

> We're so thankful, Lord, to be Yours forever, to have forever to get to know You better and better. The privilege and the joy of being about Your work, getting to join You in what you're doing, first in our own lives and then getting to bring you to others and partnering with you. Lord, speak to us tonight. We welcome You and thank You for each one here, so loved by You, knowing absolutely everything. We are so loved. And you complete what you've begun. Use tonight as part of that. In Your name, amen.

**Introduction**

As you know, from last week, we're in the section in Philippians 1, where Paul is letting the Philippians and the Holy Spirit through him, letting us know what he was walking through and how he walked through it. It's quite clear he is not just sharing information about his own difficult circumstances because he wants a pity party. He is giving us an opportunity to see how the Lord has led him in a mature walk with the Lord in these types of seasons that we would never choose on our own, but which the Lord uses so mightily in our lives as well as the lives of others.

Though Paul's circumstances were in prison because of jealousy and political reasons, even more than religious reasons, we have similar circumstances where we are in situations where there's not much we can change. It may be a difficult season in a marriage, in extended family, in a missions or work or a church situation. We have students with lab and work situations where this very much applies. Whatever our circumstances, it's so helpful to look over Paul's shoulder at what he has wrestled and worked out and learned from the Lord over the long run of his ministry.

We have the privilege of sharing in that. As always, listen for what the Lord underlines for each one of us. It's not just adding head knowledge and maybe agreeing with it. We're all pretty good at that or what I don't agree with. But listening to grow, letting the Lord change us each week, looking for Him to do that. I am spending time personally with the Lord in these passages before and after our times to make sure that I've heard and responded to what the Lord shows me and encourage you to do the same and also to listen for others. As you welcome these truths and walk it out in your life, you will start to have lots of people come to you who need to hear exactly what you have learned and the testimony of how you've seen the Lord at work as you've trusted Him to walk these verses out.

**Recap: triumph over circumstances**

Let's dig into it together. We looked at Paul and how his circumstances were contributing to the progress of the good news. The word was going forth, with many people participating in the proclamation of the gospel who were intimidated by Paul. Some were speaking the word fearlessly, some out of envy and strife, and others saw it as their chance to be the big cheese of evangelism. But Paul says, who cares? The issue of why they're doing it is between them and the Lord, not between them and Paul. Paul just rejoices in the fact that the word is getting out there.

The Lord is using his unjust imprisonment to reach people he could never have reached otherwise, even into Caesar's household. It was unlikely he would have had access there if not for being imprisoned unjustly and chained to his captive audience, Caesar's bodyguards every four hours. Paul is talking about Jesus, whether they want to hear it or not. So we know that the Lord was doing far beyond all he could have possibly dreamed of by having him in this unjust position. The Lord loves to do far beyond all we could possibly have thought of in situations that we would never choose.

When I was hospitalized last fall, I reached nurses and got to talk about the Lord and pray with them, people I would never have known otherwise. It wasn't my favorite place, wouldn't have chosen it. But as you welcome what the Lord gives and make yourself available, it's astounding what He does, and that's sheer joy. 

**Verses 18-20: circumstances leading to salvation (sanctification)**

So Paul's rejoicing as we get to verse 18: "In every manner, what a pretense or truth Christ has proclaimed. In this I rejoice, and I will yet rejoice." It's furthering the spread of the gospel and new life in Christ.

He says, I know that via your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, it shall come out to me unto salvation. He's not talking about his coming to the Lord in the first place but the further outworking of his salvation. There were things about Paul's flesh that came to the fore because of the imprisonment. He was a strong character and probably had a few words here and there that he then went to the Lord about afterwards. Thank you for your prayers.

You could see us signed in, but you couldn't hear or see us because of the glass of water that got dumped over on my desk just as I was about to turn on the camera and the audio. We didn't have a rag towel right here in the study, so Erica went to get one. Actually, you didn't miss any choice words. I thank the Lord that I didn't react. I acted. I responded to the need, but I didn't react.

Paul is also rejoicing because he is growing in his walk with the Lord. Work out for him unto salvation. There are constant opportunities each of us has every day to notice other ways that we can trust the Lord according to His word and by the power of the Spirit to raise us up out of the natural deadness of normal life, natural life. Hopefully, the new life in the Lord is what's becoming our normal life more and more.

He also says in Philippians 1:20, "According to my eager expectation and hope that I shall not be put to shame in anything, but with all boldness, even though as always Christ should be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death". That people will come to see the Lord. First of all, it's hearing about the Lord, then Paul himself growing, and now that others who are able to observe Paul firsthand or at a distance will get to see more and more of the wonder of who Jesus is, who our Lord, anointed Lord is, and demonstrate that in fulfillment, as we've noted on occasions of John 14:12, Jesus saying that we who trust in God and accept the gospel will not only do the things that Jesus did, but greater.

In terms of living a thoroughly Godly life, we can't even come near. We grow in that direction more and more. But during this life, we'll never get near living a perfect life as Jesus did. So he's got to be talking about something else. And I think that's why Paul is talking about his working out his salvation and then Christ being exalted through what people observe through his body, not just what they observed, but what they learn through what Paul does, that people seeing the transformation. And of course, we know from Acts, people saying, isn't this the one who was running around persecuting the church and dragging believers off to prison? And you really want me to go to see him anyway?

Demonstrating the gospel is not just a promise of a wonderful afterlife but an amazing transformation of life while we're still here. This section, and even these three verses, underline what is always available to us, even in the worst of circumstances. Even when we have prayed that the other person will change, that the circumstances will change, and it's not looking likely, or at least not for a while. What is always open to us that nobody can block except us. And there is joy. He's talking about rejoicing as he steps back to the glimpses he has of what God is doing through these circumstances. We can have joy just thanking the Lord even where we don't see it yet, or may not until we're home with Him. But we know that He is at work as we welcome Him. Thanking the Lord for that. I wouldn't have chosen this, Lord. I am asking for a change. But as long as it isn't happening, thank You that I can rejoice and I do in what You're doing. May I grow. That's always open to me. Grow in the Lord. And I have purpose. I can show forth the Lord more and more in whatever circumstances. Those are always open to me.

> I just reflect back on Steve's comment about the water being poured on the computer, that he responded in Christ rather than reacting in the flesh. When I'm frustrated with people, I tend to react rather than respond. And that's exactly what you're talking about. 

> Yeah, it's wonderful. Especially if those around me know my typical response and I respond otherwise, it really is an announcement to them that the living God is at work.

Years ago, we had a friend with two toddlers and twins. And it was never quiet. It was never clean in her house. And there were times where she was just losing it. At one point, she started to yell at the kids and realized, "Oh, Lord, this is not from You." She called out in a loud voice, "All right, everybody stop. Mommy is getting angry and that is not from God. He loves you. Mommy is going to kneel down on this dirty kitchen floor and you watch Jesus change Mommy." She knelt on her dirty kitchen floor and prayed out loud, "Oh Lord, I am just getting angry at these precious children whom You love and I love. This is not from You at all. I just give You my anger, replace it with Your love and patience." She got up, and the kids saw her patient. They were watching the transformation. And then there were times where she'd start to lose it and the kids learned a life lesson. "Mommy, mommy, quick, pray!" When you're losing it, pray, turn to the Lord, renounce the direction, and welcome His direction instead.

**Verses 21-22: Christ in life and Christ in death**

Even those times when we start out wrong, right in the middle you can stop and people can see the transformation. It's encouraging to know it's never too late for redemption. My purpose is that even in these circumstances that I can't seem to change, I can always welcome the Lord showing Himself through me, even if I'm flat on my back. Instead of feeling helpless and depressed or just angry, I have purpose available to me if I welcome it. And that's so helpful to know. He says "that Christ may be exalted in me, whether by life or by death." To him, the important thing is really not which one. It's not the circumstances. We tend to make the circumstances the important thing. But he's saying that's really secondary. That's the setting in which I get to do what I am welcoming and devoted to doing. My purpose can be accomplished no matter what the setting is.

Being exalted in his body through death would mean that the testimony would be evident as he approached death. I remember an account of a 15-year-old boy in Africa, where there was widespread persecution going on, I think it was Uganda during Idi Amin. He was about to be burned alive. And he said, "I'm not afraid of the fire that takes me to Jesus." Many came to the Lord through watching his death. The expression actually came to be a fairly widespread declaration: "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." The more people are killed for their faith, the more people come to faith.

In his life, in his continuing ministry, whenever it is that the Lord says, you're done. You've done what I wanted you to do on earth, and now it's time to move. He says, "For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I'm to live in the flesh, this would be more fruitful labor for me. I do not know which I choose." Now, of course, it isn't his choice, but what he's saying is interesting to ask that. I really puzzled over that first. What does he mean? He choose. I don't know which I choose. Any thoughts? How would he choose? What would the outcome look like if he chose continuing to live in the flesh? Or if he chose dying? This would have to mean if God said, okay, Paul, you choose. What would you say?

> The only thing that I can think of is that he could choose to deliberately anger those who are in authority over him, of his life and death, to push their buttons so that they would take his life rather than waiting and letting God lean on their hearts to choose that. I've thought about that. I know there were quite a few reported instances during the Holocaust of people who just lost hope and on purpose ran toward the fence knowing they'd be shot. He certainly could have managed that.

**Our purpose in life**

I thought it may be more his will to live. We have had various friends, even former students who've contracted cancer and it's declared terminal. Do you just give up at that point? Or do you have reasons to live? We'll look at that in a minute, what reasons are to live and fight it. We've had friends who've said, I want to make sure that if I die from this, it's because God is taking me home and not because I gave up and fought really hard to live. And the reason was, I have so many people to love. It wasn't I haven't gotten to do all the fun stuff I wanted to do or achieve what I wanted to achieve. I have so many people to love.

We've had various ones, some who still are fighting because of so many people to love and are still here. But if you give up and just give in to despair, then a lot of times you don't end up living. Even secularly, nurses will say, you've got to fight for this if you want to live. There's a part of that that's true in the Lord as well, even though He makes the final choice.

Then, of course, what I think he is saying, no matter what other implications, and we discussed a number of them just now, I think what he is saying at minimum is, if I had the choice, and I'm sure the implications are, you know, what am I praying for? Am I praying to live longer here, or I'm praying that the Lord will take me home? And he says, I don't know. I'm not praying for one or the other. I'm gripped from both. I have the desire to part and be with Christ. That's many times more better. The Greek, he says, he says that is, "well, actually, there's many more better" is just about a literal rendering. He triples it. Better is already a comparative. More better is not standard English. Mo betta is a beautiful expression in Hawaii pigeon, and it is a standard way of saying it. I believe Spanish, the comparative, basically is a similar formulation. Somebody who I'm Spanish speaker, I can't think of it right now. I've heard people speaking Spanish, I believe that's what it is. But anyway, Paul is just really piling it on. Every way you possibly look at it, it is better and it's more better than you can possibly imagine. It's true. It's exceedingly abundantly beyond all we can ask or think when you're talking about desire to go and be with Christ.

A friend, one of the pastors significant in my equipping, discipled me for years for counseling from the Word. He gave a message at a memorial service that really had quite an impact on the people because memorial services often have many unbelievers present. When a believer dies, it's a great opportunity to give unbelievers a glimpse into what believers have that is available to them. He took the end of Ephesians 3 and he said, "people ask me what heaven is like." He immediately got a lot of people's attention. After a pregnant pause, he said, "I don't know." Then he said, "oh, I know a lot about it. And what I know about it is wonderful." But Paul says here that "He is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all we can ask or think." So that means no matter how much I think or ask for about it, because of what I do know about it, it's beyond that. And not only that, it's abundantly beyond that. Moreover, it's exceedingly abundantly beyond that. He really had people's interest at that point.

Paul is saying that to remain in the flesh is more necessary on account of you. I've got all these people to love. I've got all these people to serve in whatever sort of ministry, personal ministry and for some people, vocational ministry as well. Our life here is to be a life of showing others the love of the true God who is eager to share His life and welcome us into fellowship with Him. He's letting us in.

> (sharing) The older I get... Kids are gone away. They're not geographically far away, but they're in their own lives. My sons aren't believers. One son has three kids. Those people are on my mind and heart. I almost feel guilty thinking about where I get to go. I don't know what to have with them. It's really a burden to me. Where God has me now, it's really a challenge for me to find the purpose in my day-to-day life. There's nobody here, and I don't see very many people on a day-to-day basis or a week-to-week basis, except at church.
> 
> So I want my family to be saved. I want to do whatever God would let me do in terms of prayer or whatever to participate in that. Meanwhile, if He's got something for me to do, I'm happy to do it. If it wasn't for my burden for my family, I would be quite content to think that my life is coming close to being at an end. I'm almost 80, right? It's not what I expected at this point in my life, to be so much on my own. For various reasons, even my adult children don't reach out to me all that much. It's a different kind of challenge than I ever, and it really is a challenge to know, okay, God, what are we going to do today? I'm involved in a few things. For the last probably year and a half, it's been my, how do I do what you guys are talking about here through this passage in my living room when there's nobody here.

Because of how we're created, we long to be useful. I know when my mom couldn't walk anymore and was in skilled nursing, that was the thing that just ate into her. She wanted to be useful, and she was, actually. She prayed, and all the caregivers loved to come in because she cared for them. She would grab their hand. She grabbed the head nurse's hand and said, how are you? I know that your life is really hard. You care for all of us and we can be so crabby. How are you? The whole staff loved to be in there with her because they felt so loved and appreciated and prayed for.

**The hidden power of prayer**

Prayer definitely is one thing. Billy Graham had a friend who was a paraplegic and she couldn't move but she was a powerhouse of prayer. Whenever he was speaking somewhere in the world, he always informed her. She prayed and people responded. Verse 19, Paul says, "For I know that via your prayers and the provision of the spirit of Christ Jesus, this will come out for salvation for me." We're so used to talking about prayer that I don't think any of us begin to grasp how powerful it is. I know I pray for many people, but I know that I still don't begin to grasp the power of it.

I think Erica may have quoted Tennyson's statement. "More things are wrought through prayer than this world ever dreams of." 

> I know prayer is important, and I pray for them. I pray for lots of different things, but I really know that I don't pray as much as I could. I have tons of time. A lot of it is because I don't exactly know what to say. If I don't take time to pray, there's an anxiety behind that. Something about praying is, "what if He doesn't answer?" He promises to answer, we just don't know how He will answer. It's like a test of my own faith. 

Yes. A lot of it He answers through His word, and we'll pose questions to Him, and then as we're going through the Scriptures, just, you know, whatever way we do such that over time we're getting exposed to the totality of God's written word, something will pop out. 

People say, "God didn't answer my prayer". Well, He did. In terms of requests, He has three answers and only three categories of answers: yes, no, and not now. Re not knowing what to say: there's a story of a young lady who came into a prayer meeting and she started in, "Oh You are a great God who...". And a little old lady in the group poked her gently and said, "just call Him Father and ask Him something!" I think God really wants us just to talk to Him like we talk to anybody else.

My mother had something, an aid. She developed a very close walk with Jesus, starting after most people, even longtime believers, are becoming ossified in their faith. Now, she was a God-fearer from an early age. She was brought up in church, but she didn't see the institutional church that she was brought up in. She didn't see what she knew had to be the real thing beyond that. She left that, but she always prayed. If there was any challenge, struggle with any of us four boys, she often would get up in the middle of the night and do ironing and pray. But she didn't get to know Jesus personally until she was in her 60s. In the next 30 years, you have probably never seen anyone who grew as fast in her faith as she did.

She had an aid that helped her to pray because of the same sort of conceptual challenge of talking to somebody I can't see. She used a chair, acknowledging to Jesus that it's not where You're sitting physically today. But it makes it easier for me to think of you as sitting here in this chair, because then I can focus on You, even though I don't see you with my eyes, and I can relate to you the way I'm used to relating to a person I can see.

This approach is similar to the principle of truly devout people, especially in the Eastern Orthodox Church, where they have icons, and they are quick to tell you, "we do not pray to the icon. The icon is not an idol. An icon is a picture or inspiration." People often use artistic renderings of people's concept of how Jesus looked or how he would have looked if he had had their ethnic racial features. They like to look at that and help them think of Him as a real human being.

This principle is also applied in geriatric care, where caregivers are urged to ask patients, especially people in long-term care, and especially have some family member dig out some pictures of themselves from when they were the caregiver's age. This helps patients relate more readily. Medical schools now teach this during rotations, suggesting that having a picture of a patient from their late 20s, they will be able to relate to you much more readily.

Praying scripture for others is very helpful. Because then you don't have to say "if it's Your will" to the Lord, you know it's His will. I will sometimes pray and ask the Lord for specific scripture for a specific person that I know I'm called to focus prayer more on. One lady, whose main issue was worry, was pleased when I shared Philippians 4 with her, praying that the Lord would replace her worry with entrusting to Him and so on. She was so pleased because then that led her into that passage and she could pray from herself. I have found as I pray from scripture for people, it's really welcoming the Lord's doing what I know He's poised and eager to do. And if that person is a believer, the Spirit is within them; if not, the Spirit is still there outside, and he's pretty good about poking people and wooing people.

Believers have prayed for changes in secular school districts and watched the Lord change policies just through a group devoted to praying for people. It's a much more powerful venue available to us than we begin to grasp, and it's always available. So I think something really helpful.

Prayer is powerful. But the important thing is not to focus on my praying, but on the One to whom I'm praying. It's about Him. It's not about me. The prayer is appropriating His resources.

**God's eagerness to answer prayer**

One thing I've found really helpful with prayer is recognizing that anything that is legitimate for me to pray for, meaning anything that is in accordance with God's will, because it has to do with receiving His gifts and becoming like Him, I'm not getting God to do anything. He is far more eager to deliver the blessing than I am to ask for it.

People ask why God doesn't just do it. Our understanding is this life is all about our learning to participate with Him, and He's not going to impose His will. The scariest thing about the creation is giving us free will. We have taken full horrendous use and full latitude with that, the horrible things that people do because they can.

I think all of us at some time have considered, as we are aware of the horrendous evil, not just evil, wickedness in this world. I understand the distinction between evil is that which damages life, and wickedness is the determination to hurt others. Then you're seeing the extent of the wickedness and just say, how can the Lord allow that? The only answer I can give is only because the good that He is able to bring out of it far outweighs the cost, and the good that He brings out of it lasts forever. The cost is relatively very short term.

"Even though now for a little while, you've been afflicted with various trials." That's 1 Peter 5 at the end.

And in 2 Corinthians 4: Paul says this momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory. And then you read his cataloging of what he's been through. Momentary light affliction!

I also use the news as something to pray from. I don't want to bury myself in it because then you get depressed. But know enough so that I can pray wisely for our nation and internationally too. There's a pretty endless list there, but just ideas. We should move on, but we'll pray for you, and you can pray, Lord, are there people that you want me to pray for or to bless today?

Sometimes it can be a phone call. Just one that you know is a shut-in or going through a rough time, someone initiating a phone call can just make some people's day.

> I'll just say what I was talking about, focusing outside, having the chair there, and that kind of idea. It doesn't work for me, but I just flashed through my mind, and I think this was the Lord saying, here's an idea. I live two blocks from Santa Clara University. I can walk there in three minutes if the light's green, and I could go sit there. There are all kinds of icons around there, crosses, the church itself, and representations of Christ. And I could go sit there and pray. Sometimes I just need to get out of here.

You can sit and watch the students and pray for them. You will see so much. Every single one of those students needs prayer. Some of them, the need for prayer is very evident as you watch them. When we walk through campus, it's a constant cry for prayer. 

> I'm sitting here going, of course I could do that! I mean, I just, I walk down there periodically, but I've never thought of it as a prayer walk, I guess. So thank you. Those are good words.

I pray for, I'm on campus, I see students I don't know, and I can see people that have obvious needs, and it's an opportunity to pray for them. I also see young women who look like they are quite innocent, and I pray for their protection because I know how predatory the scene is with the so-called freedom that is being pushed so hard.

**Paul's process in coming to rest in the Lord**

Paul says, "Remaining in the flesh is more necessary on account of you." Before we go on with that, I think it's really helpful to see these verses as what Paul himself has really worked through as he's sitting there year after year, a man who loves to be active. He's been imprisoned for years now, and his body is pretty beaten up from all the beatings and the shipwrecks and everything else that he's been through. He's really letting us get a glimpse of his inner process of working through with the Lord. Would I like to be out of here and have a new body and see the Lord face to face? Of course, why would I not? But he's really sharing that process that he must have gone through at various times.

Why am I here? How do I be useful to the Lord? How can I fulfill the calling He's given me of proclaiming the gospel to people who haven't heard? And then he realizes, oh, they're here guarding me. People who have medical things have realized the caregivers are people to love and pray for and reach out to because they have our lives, and many have had very special opportunities. But here he is again, looking the worst-case scenario in the face. It's really easy for us to try to avoid thinking about the worst-case scenario. It's just too scary to do that. But looking at it right in the face, what if my life ends here? That's it. They chop my head off or whatever they choose to do. And he's saying, that's way better. Then I get released, and I get to be with the Lord. It's helpful to look at the worst-case scenario and say, "what does that really look like in the Lord?"

I've had various friends with cancer who've said, "someone close to me died of this, and it was horrible. I don't want to go that path" and being able to say, "but yeah, they didn't know the Lord, and they walked it by themselves. You have the Lord, and you get to learn how to walk it with Him where the process is not the central thing and all that you've got." We got to see that that was exactly the case as that person did walk with Him all the way through. It helps to focus on what is ahead.

I was reminded of the from Handel's Messiah, what's quoted from Job 19, verse 25 and on in the midst of Job's suffering where he's lost everything. But his wife, he says, curse God and die. So she's no help. And friends who were... Don't talk like one of the foolish women. He doesn't call her a foolish woman. He says, don't talk like one of the foolish women. But here in the midst of all of this, he says, Job 19:25. "And as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. And at the last, he will take his stand on the earth. Even after my skin is destroyed, yet from my flesh, I shall see God, whom I myself shall behold and whom my eyes shall see and not another." Then he goes back to his circumstances. But to have a solid focus on who the Lord is, and what we would call often worst-case scenario actually is just gives hope and focus no matter which the Lord chooses. It's a good path. It's how do I walk it?

The end of Revelation 21 and 22 are beautiful. I got to read those to my mom as she was closing in on her last breath and saying, mom, you will get to see this river of life soon. You will get to see the throne of grace and see the Lord face to face. He himself will wipe away every tear from your eyes. She was just so full of joy as she went out in anticipation. It's helpful. And it's helpful for living life well now.

We had some former students from the South, and they said, nowadays people are so fast to get rid of any sign of death and suffering, just get it out of here. At Stanford, if there's a suicide, there is exactly one week of openness when people are facing their mortality and really open to talking about it. And then it just lasts one week, no more. Because of all the academic pressure, the amount of backlog that happened in that week when they couldn't help but pull back just drives them to shove it completely out of their mind and just push ahead to recover academically. But it's to shut it out. I don't want to think about that. The person from the South said where she came from, you'd actually keep Aunt Tilly in the house for a couple of days after she passed because they felt it was really healthy to live facing into death and that you make much better choices. It's like the end of Moses Psalm 90: "Lord, teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom." To live knowing I'm not immortal. I will go on forever with the Lord, but my opportunity to act here is limited, and I want to make the most of it.

**Purpose in life: to love, serve, and bless with Jesus**

And that's what Paul then is saying, though he is eager to go home and be with the Lord. He has purpose in staying and fruitful labor for me, and to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. So for him, I would love to go home, but for them, he wants to stay so that he can continue to pray, so that he can bless every way he can.

Last night, going through this with the class, it really brought me to realize where I stand with this. Now, I have to admit, I'm not in Paul's position. I'm not being brutalized. I'm not imprisoned and so forth, so I don't have the incentive to want to depart and be with Christ. It's not that there are not plenty of trials and difficulties in this world, and it's not that our lives aren't full of struggles and unpleasant things, as well as wonderful things.

But I had to say my first, I talked about this in class, and I hadn't taken time to consider it, but it was kind of a heads up on what I have been aware of. I'm very conscious of the fact I'm so thankful for the health that the Lord has given us and how He's preserving me. And I do pray that He continues to enable His body to function well so that I can complete the work that He's given me to do in the ministry. And it's daunting to think of actually completing it, but I could not possibly.

We were at PBC Palo Alto this week, and we're not there very much because most of the students are at other churches. To have student contact, which is important on Sundays, we spend most of our time at other churches locally. And people ask me, "Oh, are you back to visit?" No, we're living here as usual. "Oh, I thought you moved up to Washington." A lot of people get the idea that we've moved up there. No, during breaks in the academic year, we like to get up to where we can concentrate on working on publication and ministry. But no, we're still very much here and very actively moving rapidly through the 50th year of full-time ministry on the campus.

But I am very aware there is so much that the Lord has opened up from His word that we benefit so much in our personal lives and is so fruitful in the ministry that has got to get out. We're working on trying to publish it. We were told a while ago by our board, it would be criminal if this stuff didn't get out. We agree with that, but we sure wish it would happen better and faster. There is so much, and it's questionable whether it'll ever get out. We're trying to work on the most important stuff.

As we're getting ready for bed last night, I had to say to Erica, I know it's going to be wonderful when it's time to be home with the Lord, but really, don't think about that. I'm not interested. I don't wish I were home with the Lord because the getting good fellowship with Him, nothing like what will be when we're there. But getting to serve now, and quite frankly, it made me think, not during the class but afterwards as before getting ready, I said actually I don't know what I'll do there that would be as fruitful as fulfilling as what the Lord's allowing us to do here.

It's just... I'm interested in going to the country club. People ask me, are you retiring? I can't retire. I love the fact that our family is growing and have such a wonderful relationship with our one grandchild. The two twins that now what three and a half weeks, especially since I haven't met them face to face, I don't have much of a relationship with them yet, but that's wonderful. But if I were just to focus, retire in order to say this season now is all about family, I would feel really selfish.

And so I understand the struggle there. And so Paul says, we can't go on forever. In two different ways we're talking about here. "Persuaded thus, that remaining in the flesh is more necessary on account of you." I know that. He's saying "I'm convinced." He doesn't know for a fact. And he keeps saying, whether or not , because he knows it's in the Lord's hand and not his. But I think he's saying the same thing I was just saying about where I am at this point, that the need and the opportunity is so obvious. So Paul says, "I'm persuaded". He's talking about what he's convinced of. He's not talking about what he knows as an objective fact. "I will remain and continue with you all unto your progress and joy in the faith." This growth is mutual, involving both ends. People in ministry have a lot of growing to do and need to do a lot of growing. Spiritual warfare adds to that because the adversary keeps trying to provoke the flesh to undercut the ministry. And so we have to deal with it in order to keep the ministry going. More pressure than we would have without the ministry.

**Verse 25**

"Unto your progress and joy of the faith in order that your boast in me may abound in Christ Jesus." He clarifies that this is not exalting himself there when he says your boast in me. He's talking about the confidence you have in what the Lord is doing and has been doing through me and will continue to do through me as opportunity remains. And he says that through my coming to you again, that what you were expecting the Lord to do through my coming to you again will really happen if indeed I do get to come to you again. He keeps stating his confidence and then qualifying. And he qualifies in verse 27, stating, "Whether coming and seeing you or remaining absent."

So he's persuaded, he knows what he would like to do. He's confident of what would come out of that option, if that's the option the Lord chooses at this point.

It's beautiful that his whole meaning for his life is in that verse 25, to continue with believers and baby believers, the churches, and for their progress and joy in the faith. And he states that also in Second Corinthians 1:24, "Not that we lord it over your faith but are workers with you for your joy, for in your faith you're standing firm. And it's so helpful to just have it clearly in view with any person I'm in contact with or thinking about, that my purpose is to either encourage them forward in the faith and joy in the faith, progress and joy, or toward that if they are not yet believers.

And we know, again, Cora, Paul talks about the burden that he has to pray for all those churches. Those are his kids and the burden of the churches are on him every day. He says that he is praying and he says at one point agonizing in prayer, agonizo, agonizing in prayer for them, for their progress, for their joy, for their growth, for their service. There's a lot of great purpose that he has in continuing, even though he's very limited in being able to get out there and do a lot. He's in a position where the big thing besides talking to the praetorian guard is praying. It's helpful to see where the Lord leads someone who is so active like Paul, that prayer is so important and the service.

I remember years ago, one of our daughters had someone in her soccer team and the husband was a psychiatrist at Stanford and got into shamanism and we kind of pulled away from having our children with them at that point. But apparently I had talked with her about the Lord quite a bit. I don't remember, but years later, a car suddenly screeched to a halt as I was crossing the street. And it was this lady and she stopped and she rolled down her window, stopped right there in traffic, and said, "You were right. It's far better to give than receive." That was just one of those. Oh, Lord. I don't remember talking about it, but she does, and that's the important thing. I remember it. It was just, that was really something. I'd forgotten about it, but boy, I remember this as clearly as if it happened yesterday. Wow.

Even grocery store clerks and so on, I keep having chances to encourage them and get chances to pray for them and have comments back and wherever you are.

Since we're near the end of our scheduled time, questions, comments, things that you would like to add to the discussion? And the next section. Examples. Then he moves into how you guys are relating to each other. And what he says at the end of chapter one is a beautiful lead into the first paragraph of chapter two, which is very, very powerful about interpersonal relationships. But we'll get there next week. Any other comments, questions? Examples. Examples from what we've just been looking at?

> I still substitute teach a little bit, but I've mostly retired in 2020. Over the last three years, I've been waking up in the morning and saying, "Okay, God, what do you have for me today?" and just seeing how it unfolds. A friend wanted me to take her to the airport tomorrow, so I thought I wouldn't do my hiking group and agreed to help. Then she said she actually needed help on Friday, which cleared up my Thursday, allowing me to join my hiking group. And instead, Friday, which was clear, is now available for her to do that. But just the dynamics and how something I think I'm going to do suddenly disappears and then God plops something else in that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise unless I had already preserved that time is just amazing and so fun to watch how God manages the logistics of my life. 

Yeah, He's far better at it. We keep trying to engineer it and then everything changes anyway.

I was thinking of Ephesians 2:10: "We are His hand craftsmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works that He's prepared beforehand that we should walk in them. And that's been a neat verse for me to wake up to knowing the basic parameters of what I'll be doing. But there are surprises as well. And being alert to the overall that I'm committed to, of encouraging believers in the progress and joy of the faith and encouraging unbelievers toward the Lord. But then the opportunities that come up through prayer.

I walk every day and have had countless opportunities. The dog is faithful, taking her on two walks a day. Yes, he does. And you get to know the neighborhood through kids and dogs. He can't go the distance anymore, so Erica takes him on his morning walk, comes back, and continues on her walk, meeting with the Lord all along. I end up talking with people, making a comment here or there, and sometimes that leads to a real opportunity. "Lord, this is the day that You have made. I'm rejoicing and glad in it. What do we have? How can we serve together?" It's been really cool.

I thought you were going to say with doing part-time substitute teaching that you don't really have control of your calendar. Debbie, our eldest, did a season just after they moved up to Spokane where she was doing substitute teaching part-time, and it turns out the district supervisor had delightedly offered her much more than they actually could provide, which put them in a difficult position. But she had to be ready to go every day. And so most mornings she found herself all dressed up with nowhere to go. She really knows what that expression is all about. So I don't know how much notice you get. What do you do more filling in for anticipated?

> I worked at this junior high for 16 years, so I know the staff, and they will send me an email. I'm going to be gone. Could you? I typically know what I'm going to be doing a couple of weeks in advance. People are calling sick once in a while before they have to be behind the desk teaching a class with a 20-minute drive to get there. Thank you for all your time and teaching. We have tremendous respect for teachers and how the Lord uses teachers and what an important role that is. Thank you. A lot of impact in the lives of kids.

Let's pray. And then if anybody else has anything, we're glad to hang out for a while. 

> Lord, thank you. Thank you that we always have purpose. Thank you that we always have You. And Lord, we ask that whether by life or death, that You will be exalted in us and that we will keep growing as fast as we can and that we will be serving unto You, whether through prayer or direct contact or observed contact that leads to prayer and maybe opportunities later. Thank you for family and extended family and church community and neighbors. Lord, please enable us to be alert to the nudges of Your Spirit where You would have us serve and how today and even just before You that You would be exalted and where our thoughts are and our words and actions that we would develop the life of we us with You more and more and give You joy. Thank you that You are here and Lord, please lead each one in Your good plans and purposes and thank you for the joy. In Your name, amen.
