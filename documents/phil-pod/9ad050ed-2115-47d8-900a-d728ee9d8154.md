**Introduction**

Last week, you know that we're in part two of exchanging a lifestyle of anxiety for a lifestyle of peace and partnership with the Lord. If you were with us last week, we looked at some very insightful passages that clue us in that one of the major tactics of our spiritual adversary, the devil, the accuser, is to try to seduce us away from partnering with the Lord. He uses the brokenness in this world. All of us are aware of so many things that we're not in control of. This world telegraphs that all the time. The farther we go in life, the more we collect concerns as there are more people that we know and love. As there's much more craziness going on in the nation and internationally, whether you're talking on that level or the personal level or health, there is a constant reminder that we're not in control. Yet we're created in His image, created to rule, we're doers. We immediately get grabbed by these concerns and jump in to try to analyze and solve them. It can just absolutely control our entire focus. As we talked about last week, it can seem like the telescope is flipped where the issues are enormous and the Lord is tiny. How do we actually flip the telescope to reality where our mighty God, who's the Creator of the universe and manages everything, the universe is in proper perspective with all the things going on?

Let's go on from the telescope analogy. It's a good analogy. But if we think about it, it really is just reality. If we have two things in two different directions that we can focus on, such that we can focus on only one at a time, the closer we move to one to look at it, or actually even better, both are in view. But if we zone in on one of the two things that are evident, the closer we get to it, the bigger it is, the more the detail seems important. The farther the other, even though it's on the periphery, is in the background. That's the way it is. Where is our focus? It's not that we can't focus on more than one thing at a time if we keep them in balance.

The adversary's game always has been to seduce people's attention away from the Lord, and it started right at the beginning of Genesis 3. It's been his game all along, and he hasn't changed it because it works so effectively. Remember that Paul, through 2 Corinthians, tells us that we're not ignorant of his schemes. 2:11. The context there is forgiving when someone has repented rather than continuing to in any way exclude them. They need to be welcomed back. But it's true in general. We know a lot about how the adversary tries to deflect us, seduce us from the focus and the rest in the Lord. Anxiety is a major tactic of his.

As we're aware, and we looked last week at, and we're not going to go into it again, but 1 Peter chapter 5, starting in verse 6 to the end of the chapter, and also Hebrews 2:14 to 16, which both identify that the adversary uses fear to enslave us, to control us. As we're aware of that, the Lord gives us major tools so that we don't have to be had. If we're passive, we will be had. But if I recognize anytime I'm anxious, this is maybe a real thing. It may be speculation also, but whichever it is, the adversary wants to use it to get me completely focused on it. But there's a better way. That's what we're looking at tonight in Philippians 4.

Let's go to Philippians 4, and then I'll bring in another adjunct passage. It's very helpful. 1 Corinthians 7. And one note as we read, there are 10 imperatives in this passage. The Lord uses imperatives for things that are essential for us to have in mind. Steve has noted those by the exclamation points.

Let's start at the end of chapter 3, because Paul starts chapter 4 with "For this reason." So we have to look at the end of 3 to see what reason. In chapter 3, he says that we're waiting for the Lord to transform the body of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory by the exertion of the power that he has to subject all things to himself. That's what Paul's pointing to. He said, for this reason, my brethren, beloved, longed for, my joy, my crown. Actually, this is all, I put imperatives in all of this, but it's not. Anyway, stand fast. That's the embarrassment. For this reason, stand fast. Stand fast for what reason? Because life with the Lord is all about His transforming our natural bodies, naturally indwelt by sin, and expressing that sin nature into bodies that express the wonder of true life from God. What was modeled by Jesus in the incarnation and what is made available to every one of us because we've received the Holy Spirit who reproduces that life in us in this body.

That's what the process and all of the focus we've had from Romans in how to change. What kind of change are we talking about? We're changing from the natural lifestyle that we're all born with and that has been nurtured, developed, and corrupted by the influences around us through our lives but is now being transformed from what comes naturally, into an expression of true light. And so Paul says that is what's at stake. That is the opportunity. Ignoring it is the risk that is inherent in what we do, how we respond to every situation, every relationship, and everything that develops in that relationship.

And so Paul starts from a relational application, but it applies to everything that we encounter in life. So "my beloved long for my joy, my crown, my brethren", emphasizing how favored we are by God and by other true believers. And so having that in mind, who we are and why we are, what this life, what all of the things that we're going through now and will continue to go through as long as we are living here on earth. What's the point?

And so Paul comes to the specific thing, but it's not the whole thing. It's the trigger for his focusing on this. Verse 2. I heard Euodia and I heard Syntyche. Interesting names. Euodia means fragrant and Syntyche means affable, easy to get along with. And what is it about? They're slugging it out. And that's just the way life is when the flesh gets going. And one question here is, what do we know from these two verses?

By the way, while we're headed there, how does Paul know this? This is not the age of the internet and seemingly instantaneous communication. This is when it takes months for somebody to go from one place to another because the only way to communicate was in person, either yourself or send somebody. Word of this had to get to Paul from Ephesus to Rome, months of journeying, and then Paul had to respond to this news and write this letter and send his response back. This is no little thing. This is not just a little snippet of gossip. This has been considered serious enough to have all of that significance in communication of concern and of response.

And what's at stake? Who are these women? What do we know about them? They're not mentioned anywhere else in Scripture. It's all right here in verse 3. What do we know about them? Their names are in the book of life. And they've shared Paul's work. Are they baby believers who just are bringing the world right in? No. That's the miracle of the church and its survival; the world is constantly flowing into the church. Everybody who comes into the church brings the world with them. Then the Lord goes to work to get the world out of them. All of us. The flow keeps going. The Lord looks at it and He says it's a flow of opportunity. We should look at that as new believers come in. Here is opportunity for more lives to be transformed, saved from the tragedy of what comes naturally in this fallen, malfunctioning world, and let people see what God can do and be benefited by it.

Here these are seasoned believers who've served well with Paul, and it's just a reminder that conflict can happen amongst serious long-serving believers as well as new ones. Do you know what the paramount problem is on mission trips? It's the thing that typically is not included in preparation for the trip, but it's inevitable. It is the primary means of attack on the team and on the mission that the adversary uses. Team relationships? Yes. It's interpersonal conflict within the team. People try to push it off and say, we'll deal with that later. That's not what we're here for. Oh, yes, you are. You are here for it. You don't have to worry about shaming the mission and shaming the Lord by letting the people you're going to minister to see what's going on. Let them see the Lord first heal it in front of their eyes. It doesn't mean go there and get into a fight just to further the mission.

There's a little nuance in the Greek here, and I've translated it, but I will send you a copy of the translation. I urge you, true companion, help bring these women together. These are imperatives, not expletives, imperatives. Help bring them together. Literally, the verb means to bring together. But the interesting thing is, this is in what's called the middle voice, which is neither active nor passive, but combines elements of both active and passive. And when it's in the middle, which it is, it has the normal meaning of help. So it could be translated just "help these women". But I think the literal message of the word, which is used, they'd all be familiar with it. I think people would catch there's a kind of a double element to this plea: "help bring these women together."

And that's what the effect of the Lord's working in our individual lives should be, should bring us closer and closer together with our fellow believers. He urges them to think the same thing. And we've seen that in Philippians 2:2: "Make my joy complete by being of the same mind, maintaining the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose. Do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, let each of you regard one another as more important than himself."

Thinking the same thing doesn't mean having cookie-cutter minds. It's not talking about the kind of think the same thing that is part of typical communist and other such totalitarian regimes brainwashing, have everybody think the same thing. Everybody just be automatons for the state. It's not that kind of think the same thing. It's think the same thing in the Lord. Think the same way. I think thing is probably not a good translation. Probably think the same way in the Lord. Being united with the Lord's thinking. That's where the unity comes from.

As I know who the Lord is and what His agenda is, and His thoughts, which we know a lot of through Scripture toward people who are struggling, who are failing, who flat out sinned in the same area, 70 times seven. We have so much understanding of how the Lord views other people and what his intent is. And so as each of us join together with Him that brings us together.

And when you have the opportunity to help people—they could be very seasoned, very mature in some area but not in this one, or very young—you start with seeking common ground, which is the Lord. Where do we already have unity? That's where Paul always starts. And then after thanking the Lord for that, after really celebrating that unity, then you can start to talk about the different approaches.

Years ago on campus, there was a ministry couple where one was very sure that her husband was not following the Lord's agenda at all because when they had groups, he was busy running around setting up chairs and working on the sound system. She was the one who was reaching out to people and would say, "I thought that we were here to serve people and you're hardly having contact with them." It became a real conflict that affected the group. We were able to meet with her and help her see this was differential gifts; he was caring for those people with all of the background knowledge, setup, and care and so on that made those people times effective. But she didn't see it because he wasn't there. And he was enabling what she was doing, which she would not have been able to do effectively without what he was doing.

So you join together and ask, what is the Lord doing? What's His calling? How are we individually contributing to that? It may be different styles, different gifts, or emphasizing different things. It's an opportunity to say, let's pray about it. I want to understand what you're doing and share what I'm doing. Let's prayerfully arrive at what is a good service in this situation.

The Lord has given us many pictures in nature and especially in human anatomy and physiology. It teaches us so much and points to so much, and it's in Scripture. Recently, we've been aware that an octopus has nine brains. Well, that's not really quite true. What it does is each leg has a major ganglion, which is not an autonomous brain, but much of the time, each tentacle is functioning virtually autonomously. One will be poking into some hole somewhere, probing to see what's there, and with various sensory capabilities in the arm, and another one will be doing something else, and they'll be operating fairly independently. And if you watch an octopus like that of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, you watch them for a while. And a lot of time they're just parked in one place. But if you watch them, you'll see tentacles doing different things. All of a sudden, all of them together go, and the octopus goes somewhere else. So I think that's a beautiful picture of how the Lord intends us to function. We do a lot of individual things, but it's all under the direction of the one head who, when it's time for all of us to join together and do something, He calls us, and we all respond. At least we hope. That's the ideal that we should all just respond immediately and find ourselves doing the same thing, which wasn't what we were focused on at the moment previous.

Now we get to the counsel itself for anxiety. Here it is. Verse 4: "Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice." These are imperatives in the text. Cause your forbearing to become known to all people. The Lord is at hand. Make your forbearing, yes, your forbearing manner, your forbearing spirit, but how do you make it known to people? By acting on it. And that's what Paul says. He just says, make your forbearing become known to all people.

How do we do that? What's forbearing? What would it look like for Euodia to forbear with Syntyche? What would it mean for Syntyche to forbear with Euodia? It would take only one of them to start drawing the two of them together. An example for all of us. How do we do that? The Lord is at hand. The Lord is right here. That's what He promised in the last statement in Matthew.

> Student comment: One way is to not insist on your way and to be looking for the Lord.

Actually, that's a very good description of forbearing. "The Lord is at hand." The Lord is right here. Jesus said, "I am with you always to the end of the age." He is with every one of us, wherever we are, whatever we're doing. And I believe that's the point He was trying to make after the resurrection, before the ascension, during the time He was still making Himself evident visibly on occasions on earth.

I don't think the point is that His new body allowed Him to walk through walls. He wanted the disciples to realize whether they saw Him or not, He was there. There's no description of seeing Him emerge through a closed door. He appeared to them. He opened their eyes to see Him, even though He was not physically present. He allowed their physical eyes to see His actual presence as though it were a physical presence and not merely a spiritual presence. He was trying to get us used to the idea that He's always with us. Now we don't normally see Him, but that was in the transition where this idea of somebody always being with you was totally new.

The Lord is at hand. What He promised is true. The reality for a lot of us, and some of you heard me describe this before, but I've found this a very good picture. A very good friend of mine, my Bible study buddy for a long time, before we were married. He and I would spend hours and hours, and we took Bible classes together. We talked forever after the class about what we'd studied and about the Lord. When he was in the army, he wrote to me. He had not found good fellowship. He wrote to me and said, please pray for me. I have a recurrent picture that keeps coming into my mind. I'm sitting across a table from Jesus, and He is looking intently at me, and I am staring intently out the window. And how often do we? And how long does Jesus sit, looking at us intently while we're staring out the window, waiting for us to notice Him? He spends the bulk of the time. But of course, He's got plenty of other people to attend to. No matter how many He's attending to, it never interferes with His being individually available to each one of us. The key is that the Lord is at hand. He is right here. I don't have to zone in on the issue of interpersonal relations and the rubs and challenges to try to solve it because the solution, the solver of the problem, is right here.

This is very powerful because when there's interpersonal conflict, we just want to fix it. It's easy to use strong words that never get forgotten, just trying to knock people into shape or somehow make it happen. That's what the forbearing is about. He first says, back off to the Lord instead of zoning on the other person or the people or the situation. This has been so disruptive to the church that they've wanted Paul to know about it and want help. But here he says the place to start is back off to the Lord. And how do I do it? Rejoice. And that's the last thing I think of when there's conflict. I hate conflict. But he says the place to go is start with rejoice in the Lord, not in the circumstances, but in the Lord Himself. Because He's at hand, He's here. I can back off to Him, rejoice. Thank you, Lord, that you're here. You're my good shepherd. You're our good shepherd. And you love each of the people in this situation. You dearly love all of us. We know that. And thank you that you're here as the redeemer to heal as well as Lord to lead. And so, Lord, thank you that you're here.

The place to start is the rejoicing. It's kind of like thanking the Lord before the walls of Jericho, before anything ever, a pebble moved because the Lord had promised. And so He's here. The big guy is here, the good shepherd. I don't need to charge in to knock people into place or beg them, or I get to back off to Him, thank Him that He's here, to invite Him to be at work, which is where we're going. I can actually have joy because He's here, just as much as any of you are, or as Steve and I are. He's just as much here. We just don't see Him with our physical eyes.

We're hearing more and more stories of His appearing, especially to people in the Middle East. This is not just a thing of the past at all. There's a student here now who came to the Lord because of that. He's from the Middle East. He is very present, very at work. We just don't see Him with our physical eyes most of the time.

By the way, talking about Jesus making visible appearances to people, many believers sincerely wish that Jesus would appear to them. Read the Bible. To whom did Jesus appear? When in history was he appearing to people other than during the incarnation when he was there physically? It was at the beginning. It was when they had nothing else. It's the patriarchs that he was making appearances to. Once He gave the law to Moses, they had plenty to go on. They weren't living in a world that was devoid of any awareness of the Lord God. That's not asking for something advanced. It's asking for nursery school.

"Be anxious for nothing." This is the key right here. I fulfill this perfectly. I get anxious about all kinds of nothings. I'm anxious for nothing about this thing. I'm anxious for nothing about that thing. I'm anxious for nothing somewhere else. I got so many nothings I'm anxious about that I'm a champion. But I don't think that's what He means. He means don't be anxious about anything. The literal sense of the word for anxious is really to have a distracting care. And that's exactly what it is. Something that turns my attention away to something, but in the course of that necessarily turns my attention away from other things.

This, right back to Genesis 3, is the primary ploy of the adversary: to distract people's attention from the Lord. But it's more than distract. It's really seduce because the point is to lure us away from intimacy with the One who loves us and who gives life. Our receipt of life is very hindered when our attention is elsewhere. The adversary is at war against Jesus.

Remember, we, by God's commission in the creation, His purpose statement of creating us, and then His commission to the human race given to the first couple, we are to subdue and rule. Subdue means to take charge in the face of opposition by force if necessary. We've had this notion on various levels, pioneers going in and conquering the wilderness and setting up some sort of civilized, developed community and civilization and so forth. We have this in many ways that we're familiar with. But it's to subdue and rule. The adversary deceives us into thinking that we're the church beleaguered, that it's all defensive. That's not what the Lord's called us to. It's to be the Lord's triumphant, like the rampant lion. We are to be going to war, not to destroy people, but to take a war of conquest initially to subdue the earth and rule. Yes, domesticating animals is part of that. If you've been involved in the process with individual animals, horses, steers, or maybe, more commonly, if you have trained a dog, the natural instincts are not in the direction of what you want to bring about. If you train a dog, or other pets, they are much happier than they would be otherwise. There's resistance to overcome because of their ignorance of what is so much better that's available to them. Same thing with horses. Horses will fight the process of being tamed, but you don't want to see a horse in all its glory, see a horse that has learned the joy of partnering with and serving others. A masterful rider. The horses in the horse program that our girls were involved in got all excited the day before the horse show, and they loved the chance to perform before an audience and so forth.

"Be anxious for nothing." Don't let anything seduce your attention away from the Lord. The Lord is at hand. So what do we do with that? In everything by prayer and entreaty or supplication, giving Him a shopping list of concerns. With thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. Why do I give thanks? Not because God is going to do my will. When I ask, I have a concept of how I think He will answer. But that's not what my confidence is in. If it's really a prayer of faith, I'm confident that He will do what's right in answer to my concern. If it's not what I think, it will be better.

It may involve more discomfort and challenge on the way for me, which would seem to be that it's worse, but what it will accomplish is always better. At the end of Ephesians, Paul puts it, "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond all that we can ask or think to the power that works in us." That's our confidence. It's trusting Him. We have to pray and ask Him because He's a perfect gentleman in the old sense of the term. He does not gate crash. He does not force Himself. He's the perfect landlord. The tenants have the right to manage the property, not destroy it, but they have the prerogative to use it responsibly, however they see fit. That's the way He treats us. He doesn't want to crush us. He wants to fulfill us. He wants us to be in relationship with Him and to benefit from it with all that He wants to give by free will, desire to welcome Him and welcome what He offers to do. Before moving on, it's helpful to see that "anxious for nothing" is an imperative. It's imperative for my well-being that I don't let things that grab my attention stay there. That's like saying, "don't breathe. Don't be anxious." Immediately, I'm anxious. And why would he say that? Because it's so human to get anxious. And we've already been talking about that. And we have daily multitudes of opportunities to get anxious. And the more people that you know and love, the more opportunity to get anxious.

I was reminded that in the Sower Parable, Luke chapter eight, verses 14 and 15, he says, "The seed of the word which fell among the thorns, these are the ones who have heard the word of God. And as they go on their way, they're choked with worries and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to maturity. The seed in the good soil. These are the ones who've heard the word in an honest and good heart and hold fast to it and bear fruit with perseverance."

He's saying that worry, as well as the riches and pleasures, is one of those things that can distract us so much that we don't bring forth any fruit, no fruit to maturity. We're not growing to glorify the Lord. We're not showing Him forth because our focus isn't on Him at all. It's completely consumed by what's in front of me. We're all managers. We're created to rule. We just get grabbed with, "I need to do this and this and this," and get grabbed by the, "I'm out of control here. I don't know." There are other people involved, and I can't control their wills. We just absolutely get controlled by that.

He's saying it's imperative for our well-being, as well as for our effective service with Him, that we don't let these things take over. Don't let it be a distracting care, imperative. But what do I do with it? This is the effective thing to do with it, to take the concerns overall and in detail, to entrust it to my Good Shepherd who is here, who is at hand.

It's not desperately crying out, hoping He'll hear from heaven, hoping sometime He'll act. He's right here, and I turn to Him with thanksgiving. That moves away from the "God help" prayer, which is a valid prayer, but the focus is on the desperation to solve this. The thanksgiving is a prayer that enables trust. It's a prayer of trust. It's saying thank you that you're here, thank you that you're at work, thank you that you are good, and when God means good, it's not kind of, it's really, really good, Genesis one good part after each part of His creation. We're getting a wonderful laboratory in this right now. As our 13-plus-year-old dog, who is very, very dear to us. One of our sons-in-law just characterized him as the kindest creature he has ever met. And it's really true. People love him. We still have people stop. Those total strangers will stop their cars or run back to say, that"That is the happiest dog I have ever seen. Student types and guys in their 20s, 30s will come, and they'll go by and they'll come back and they'll say, can I pet your dog?"

Our dog is clearly approaching the end. I used to lead. Now I'm bringing up the rear or holding up the rear. I've had to get a sling that straps around his hindquarters and basically with handle, you know, straps on both sides like a soft bag with carrying straps. We have to walk together. I have to be holding that. I don't have to carry the 50 pounds of the back end of the dog, though I pretty much did the first day we did it. But I have to be ready at any moment he starts to slip, his hindquarters start to collapse, to take the weight and keep him from falling down.

We're caring for him in ways we've never had to care for him. He can't walk on the hardwood floors anymore, even once, because he can't get traction. So we have to put paw mittens on him, like the ones you get in the hospital with the rubber patches on them so they won't slip. I put those on and off, put this harness on and off, and get him up off the floor at times.

Last night he needed to go out to relieve himself. I let him out and got the paw pads off, and he's out and he didn't come back in the time he normally would. It was a little longer, so Erica and I put on bathrobes, took flashlights, and went out. We got a little taste of the shepherd after the lost sheep. We looked around and finally found him in the backyard. He was there, lying down. He saw us come around the corner, his tail was wagging, but somehow he had tripped over a redwood branch that had broken off in the storm. He was lying there. Any other time, I think he would have been able to just pull himself out of it. But he was lying there, and it's beautiful. He was lying there waiting for the master mistress to come. He knew we would come. He knew he would be rescued. He was there patiently waiting, and he just went nuts when we showed up. We got him back in the house. We're going to bring food to him. Sometimes he'd get up and eat. But he is the most thankful creature we have ever seen. He always thanks us for everything. Really, he does. He loves it at Christmas with the giving of the presents. When there's a present for him, he's excited about the presents other people get. When there's a present for him, he wants to know all about it. When he opens it, it'd usually be one of these little stuffed toy animals. He will take it and go around the circle and show it to each person in the circle and wag to say, thank you. One Christmas, Erica Cowdery went around the circle 10 times with this thing.

Anyway, with thanksgiving. Yes, there's thanksgiving after the fact for a provision. But this is thanksgiving before the fact, because I know He will answer.

> Student comment: I'm listening, and I appreciate something. I think, Erica, you said at the beginning when you were commenting on the "be anxious for nothing" is like saying don't breathe.
>
> I know in my own circumstances, when I've worked to implement the imperatives in Philippians 4, I feel like I'm doing what I am told to do, but that the anxiety is not controllable by me. It's not like I have a choice. Maybe that's wrong. Maybe I do. But if we could talk about that at some point, because my experience is, okay, there's this big pressure of anxiety weighing down. That is, I'm not in charge of, I'm not choosing it. Then all these actions over here, you try to do those, go through it and do it, but it doesn't really... there are two different realms.

This is wonderful. Thank you for bringing this up. This is part two of three. This is really good because you're pointing us all to the need for part three. Next week, we will take a series of specific kinds of anxiety and look specifically at how to appropriate this wisdom and apply it and answer some of those questions you're bringing up, so thank you. Perfect, but go ahead, Marianne, just in general.

> Remembering the track record when God has provided and relieved that anxiety through, you know, whether a yes or no, or maybe however, but the answer is helpful, independent of the type of anxiety. I think that's part of what we see in the Psalms. We see the confidence that comes from, you know, this is overwhelming, this is nuts, this is not like anything I've seen before, but You have always come through. You have shown that You have the power to overcome anything. You've done it every time I've been in this kind of situation. This one's unique, each one is, but I know You and I know Your character and I know Your faithfulness, and now I'm getting a chance to see it in a new area.

I just heard from one of our two favorite pen pals. This time it was the state of California. You owe us $7,000. You calculated your taxes wrong. You said it was 2,000 something. It was 7,000 something. And then you deducted the deductions and our numbers agreed there. We came out with the same number after we subtracted the deductions. Your optical scanner misread my seven. You thought it was a two. Anyway, it doesn't matter because we came out in the same place. But then where we said how much estimated tax and carry forward we had on account with you, you say we had nothing.

I know what triggered this. A couple of years ago, we suddenly got a check from the state of California for $18,000. And I said, what? What in the heck is this? I could finally figure it out. Then you get the check, then you get the explanation later and so forth. This is refund overpaid taxes. I don't think so. I actually kept the check for a year and I didn't cash it because I was going to send it back and say, look, put this in our future tax account because I don't think this is right. But I finally worked over all the numbers. I couldn't see anything wrong with their calculations, and I finally said okay and I caved into the fact that I knew the check would stale date in one year. No big deal, the state would just have to issue a new check, and so I deposited it. Wrong move. I should have sent it back to them.

What do I get now? I found this is the second time they've come to us and said, you said you had the money on file on account with us to pay it. We say you didn't. Well, you did have it. You refunded it without cause. And after it sat in your coffers for a year, not accruing any interest for us, you say because half of it was owing to you for a year, you're going to charge us penalties and interest on half the amount of money for two-thirds of the time. Right. Now I get to send correspondence to my pen pals in Sacramento instead of in Oregon, Utah. I've had plenty of ones with them.

I've learned to see these as an opportunity for the Lord. I looked at this and I was thinking, oh, no, just as we're getting rolling on this big push on book five, now I've got this. And then the Lord said, what's the significance of this? Is this ruining the ministry because you have to take the time to battle us out with them? "Be anxious for nothing." Everything. This is another be anxious for nothing lab. Wake up. What do you think you're teaching this week? What teaching tonight? This is it. This is it. You've gone through this. You've gone through so many iterations and you used to be terrified of the IRS and so forth. You used to just get tied all in knots and you learned to say, oh, we just heard again from our pen pals. We just got more correspondence. I first caught that from my father's accountant who said to me one time in his office, but we got some correspondence from the IRS. Just a matter of fact, we got some correspondence. That's just every day for him. In that case, he wrote to them. I didn't dare do it. Actually, I had drafted a letter on one thing and the accountant was writing. He said, no, no, don't say that. He, as a CPA, could write to them and say, we disagree and go on from there.

Anyway, so the Lord has taught me from initially painful, then to annoying and distressing but no longer threatening. He's teaching me to fear God and not fear man in the form of tax agencies. "Be anxious for nothing and in everything by prayer and entreaty with thanksgiving, let your request be known to God." I'm taking the time to thank Him for this and thank Him also that there's a time for me to respond to this and to let Him show me how to respond and then write the letter within the time frame in which they've given me to respond now.

"And the peace of God, surpassing all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus." The peace of God. Where does it come from? Entrusting it all to Him with Thanksgiving. I'm at peace because no matter what, in this case, the California Franchise Tax Board thinks the reality is and what I need to do and not only pay, actually pay back to them the money that we already gave them that they refunded to us that we would have stayed with them if they hadn't not just straighten out what they were dealing with at the moment, but cleaned out our entire account and sent it to us.

Trusting that to Him, with thanksgiving, confident that this is from the Lord, it's for my continued growth. It's for my continued growth in eternal life, in getting to know my Heavenly Father and my Lord Jesus more and more intimately and deeply. I get to see them deal with this. I've seen them deal with the FTB before. I've seen them deal with the IRS before. He's always come through. The Lord has always come through, and He will again.

Now, this is a new, unique situation. Of course, I don't need to go back through the same other ones over and over again. So He gives me a new one. This is something new to trust. Before I even begin to think about how to respond to this thing or start pulling out the tax records from 2023 and 2022 and backtracking this thing, I need to come to peace with God about it such that I'm not distressed by it. It's not taking my attention off of the Lord or where He wants my attention to be. It's putting my attention on Him and rejoicing, "Rejoicing the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice." Rejoicing in this opportunity to walk with the Lord and get to know Him better and see Him at work. The peace of God surpassing all understanding, all mind. If I start analyzing this with my mind, I will not be at peace. I will start looking at what they did and what they did wrong and what I should have done and followed my sense and sent that check back to them and then kept, insisting on using that to pay future taxes. Interest rates don't make it worth having the money instead of they're having it until they bill you for it. Then they say that time interest rates do matter.

Guard your hearts and your minds. Your heart is the seat of motivation, purpose. What are you after? Your mind thinks about it, so that I'm not going to find myself constantly going back to this letter and to the bill and to the fact that although they say we have $1,000 of interest and fees, we know we don't. But how do we convince them when they have the legal right to demand it, whether I actually owe it or not? That's what happens when I put my mind on the thing rather than the Lord.

And it's when I'm snug with the Lord, where I'm entrusting the matter to Him, and as other specifics come up, I trust those to Him as well as the overall picture. Stay snug with Him, thankful for what He is doing. Back to the end of Philippians 3: He is transforming my body, which is embodied sinful humanity, to embody and express the life of God. This is how He grows me up, through these kinds of situations. It's helped me to realize this isn't just a heuristic for what I should do, because that just cuts the power out of it. It's focusing on my Lord who's here, recognizing that what He's inviting me to do is the effective way. It's the real way to deal with whatever it is.

My stewing over it only highlights that there are so many parameters I cannot control. The more people involved, the more that's true. My cleverness is not enough. My logic is not enough. But instead, entrusting it and making a lifestyle of it. This isn't just once because I take it back again, right? And it comes up again. And I'm reminded of it or there are other aspects. And so thisThis is the effective thing to do. If I want a real solution, this is how to do it. And I've thought of it instead of being glued to "I've got to solve this" to make it a stimulus to jump into my Lord's lap. Tell Him all about it. Thank Him that He's there. Thank Him that He's at work. Welcome His peace, His well-being. It becauseBecause it's entrusted to capable hands, heHe's got perspective and power that I do not have. And heHe's got the timetable. I always want to solve it now. And theThe prayer isn't, "God, you've got to show me how to fix this". No. It's, "God, I know you'll resolve this, and I get to be part of it". One Scripture that has really spoken to me in this recently is John 16:33 "These things I've spoken to you that in me, you may have peace." In Me! Peace doesn't come from resolution in the circumstances. He says, "In the world, you have tribulation, but take courage. I have overcome the world." I get to go to the One who does have things in hand. The word tribulation literally means "squeezing". In the world, you're constantly under pressure, in a vice between what's right and what's the reality that's going on.

Marianne, you had a question?

Yeah, I was just going to say, for me, it's when something comes up, it's like, okay, Lord, what are we going to do about this? Knowing that He's right there and He's going to show me how heHe's going to handle it.

Very good. Exactly. That's the point. That's it.

And where Erica's mother was in skilled nursing, it was the end of her life. The Bible said it was an old man. He could scarcely talk anymore. When the sharing time came, he wanted the microphone. It's kind of like John said that John was just lying on his sick bed and they would carry him in. All he could do, all he had the strength to do was say, little children love one another and slump back on the ballot and they'd carry him back out. This man would take the microphone and he said the same thing every time: Jesus loves me. That's enough for me. Beautiful. He had turned 100, and he knew it after all those years.

His peace guards me because my mind and my heart are under the attack of the adversary. You've got to deal with this. You should have done this long ago. It's one dart and spear after another. But I can be guarded by His peace from that onslaught. As I keep entrusting each thing to Him with thanksgiving, you're here, you're my good shepherd, you are at work, you're my redeemer, you've overcome the world. Yes, it's broken, but you're here to redeem. Help guide me.


As you said, Marianne, how do we deal with this? Let me just catch these couple of verses, and as we get into applying this to examples next week, we'll go over there. "Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, righteous, lovely, praiseworthy, if there's anything of moral excellence, if any praise, reckon or focus your thinking on these things." He's got two categories here. He's got the things that are objectively true, always true, no matter where, no matter who, no matter what the circumstances are or the relationships or the challenges. And then the if, if, if. Whatever in the situation, and of course, he is applying this to interpersonal. Whatever progress, whatever growth, if there's any yet, focus on these things. Whether there's any development, any growth, anything godly that's come about yet in these people. I mean, brand new believer. Babies are a noise and a mess and an inconvenience, but they will grow beyond that. Focus on these things, which are the Lord's objectives for all of us, which also you have learned and received and heard and seen in me and, of course, in other mature believers. Practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.

Submit everything to the Lord with thanksgiving, and the peace of God will be mine. Focus on the things that are objectively true and any evidence of progress to date in an interpersonal situation and the modeling of mature believers, which not only shows the reality in practice but also gives testimony to the Lord's ability to transform human lives. Paul points out that what makes him such a star example is that he was such an absolutely impossible wreck before the Lord went to work on him. John Newton, who was a professional slave trader who came to the Lord, "Amazing grace that saved a wretch like me." He knew what it was to be a wretch. He was totally consumed with the wonder of the transformation the Lord brought about in his life, in spite of the horror of what he had done to so many lives. We see those examples as encouragement to us of the growth that the Lord brings about in us. As we practice those things, as we incorporate them into our life and apply them to whatever situation, we are able to bring peace to others. Practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. Peace of God, as I entrust everything to Him, and then as I trust Him to grow in living out His life. I bring the God of peace and the peace of God to others. It's very helpful that verse 8 and 9 is, where do I put my focus? Because as I'm entrusting the concerns to the Lord, if I go into neutral at that point, my mind will be right back to the concerns. He's saying, what's effective to do with my mind and my focus as I've put things in the Lord's lap with thanksgiving, now what? And He says, where do you focus? First, it's to thank the Lord for all of these qualities that are always true of Him. These are, "what's true, honorable, righteous, lovely, praiseworthy." That's always available in the Lord. But then also, if other people, other believers are involved, if there's conflict, I know that the Holy Spirit is there in them, that what's written on their hearts includes God's beautiful character in all of these qualities. It hasn't been lived out yet. That's part of what's causing the conflict. But I can thank the Lord who this other person is, as well as who I am. If they're actually others, they're a new creation. The Holy Spirit is there not just partially but poured out to the last drop.

We get excited about babies. People go nuts over babies, and it's all about their excitement. It's all about the potential. It's not being realized except in infinitesimal ways. They know where this is going to go. That's the way the Lord wants to look at our own lives and the lives of others who are responding to Him, no matter how new they are at it or how long they've been at it. "He will complete what He's begun," Philippians 1:6. We know it. It just is a matter of how long.

Where else do I put my focus on what the Lord has already done? When I'm focused on a problem, that's what fills the screen. I always like to use the example during Easter, late in the 50s, ladies had these gorgeous, huge floral hats. That was the Easter hat. But if you went to church on Easter Sunday, you couldn't see the preacher or anything else. You could hear the choir, but you couldn't see them. It was like the heavenly choir because you were under all these hats. You could have a gorgeous hat, but if there's a huge paint splotch right in the middle or a hole, where does the focus go? Just on the hole. You don't see the rest of the hat at all. We're problem solvers. We look for what's wrong, and that fills the screen. Part of being part of His work is first recognizing who He is, what He's already done at the core. If this other person is a believer, and I am, the beautiful character of God is already there. I get to thank the Lord for that. Pray that the person will grow, that I'll grow. Lord, thank You for where You're already at work. Where's the evidence of what You're already doing, where You're already transforming this person? Usually, I miss that completely because I'm so focused on what's not right. Take the time to thank the Lord for that and thank the other person. It goes a long way to bring you together. If you can say, I know who you are. You are a new creation. The Lord's beautiful character is there within you. He will complete what He's begun, just like in me. We're a work in process, and we've both shown it. But I see the progress that you've made here and here and here. I know it was hard-won, but you and the Lord did it together. I see the Lord in this area in your life and this area in your life. Now we have another opportunity to grow into more. I'm on the Lord's team with you, just as I hope you are with me so we can keep moving and growing into His character.

It's part of bringing the team together first with the Lord. As I'm joining Him and seeing what He's doing, and I know what He's intending to do, throwing me and this other person into more of His character and getting to know the Lord in the process, then I can initiate bringing us together and pray from that standpoint and thanking the Lord and that person for how they've grown. Huge things to bring down barriers.

Where have I seen this in Living Color and other people? I've seen it in Scripture. You look at Paul, you look at all the great biographies if you need some encouragement. How does the Lord work with real people like me who don't have it right all the time in the midst of real-life situations? Also, where do I see it around me? Other believers who are living out more of what this is, and they're a forerunner for me and can show me a vision of how I can trust You too in this situation. As I do that and practice it, look for opportunities, then the God of peace is with me. I'm partnering with Him as He's at work in this situation as well as others.

It's a very rich gem of a passage that is actually the effective thing to do when the worries hit and the concerns are there. It's the effective thing to do to further what the Lord's doing, which after all is the point. Next week, we're making this lifestyle shift part three. I'm really looking at the long-term. All of us have pet areas where something happens in that area, and we just go into orbit. It's way out of proportion because it's a vulnerable place in our armor, and the adversary loves to hit it because he knows that he can really get us spinning on it. Part of what we're looking at next week is how do I take on those pet areas so that I can close down that vulnerability and actually make it a place of strength with the Lord instead of a continuing place where I can easily be derailed.

We'll be starting with just a quick review of how to actually change, which we've been working on for years, and a summary form of that because, as you said, Beth, I can have all this truth. How do I actually do it? How do I actually do it with respect to anxiety? That's what we'll be doing. Then we'll spend the rest of the time looking at specific examples from anxiety, and you can share things, but as always, please don't share it in a way that reveals anything about anybody else that they haven't chosen to make publicly known. Honor people's privacy in their personal lives.

> Let's pray, and then we're glad to hang out. Lord, thank you. Thank you that you are actually truly at hand wherever we are, wherever in the world or the nation we are. Thank you that we don't need to cry out to the heavens and hope you're listening, that you are here, you love to hear. You are a Redeemer as well as our Lord. You're our Good Shepherd. And we praise you and thank you that you have chosen because of your love to be so involved in our lives as much as we welcome. And Lord, we ask to partner with you more and more in reality, that we won't be staring out the window, distracted by the things to manage, but instead jumping to you with thanksgiving, entrusting these things to you, and then getting to be part of your work. Thank you. Lead each of us in actually practicing this, not as a spiritual practice, but as the effective way to live and to be part of the much greater thing, not just solving the current problem, but getting to be part of your working in the midst of the circumstances of our lives. Thank you, Lord, in your name. Amen.
