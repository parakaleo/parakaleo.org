Oh Lord, thank you that you are with us. You are Emmanuel, God with us always in all circumstances. We are so thankful that we are never alone, never without your strong encouragement and help and compassion and your life within by your Holy Spirit to grow into more and more each day. Lord, thank you for your Good Shepherd's leading and care in our lives, including in times where we can't see the way, but we know that you are the way and you have the way. Lord, thank you for your beautiful creation that we looked at last week before the fall in beauty and abundance and your special creation of us as male and female. And Lord, thank you too for the grace hard luck that we will get this week of the effect of the fall including on us as male and female. Lord, may we learn not just the bad news but learn wisdom from staying on top of it with you the Redeemer. May we listen for the strategic ways that as we understand what's happened, we can stay above it and not just continue it by the power and life of your Spirit and be part of your redemptive work in a broken world.

Thank you for each one here. Open our ears to hear you and to hear, especially what's for each of us tonight, as well as equipping to come alongside others with wisdom and compassion. Thank you, Lord, in your name. Amen.

Welcome. Quick recap, because it's been a full week. As you know, last week, we got the only glimpse before the fall from the one who was there, from our amazing Creator, God, Genesis 1 and 2. In Genesis 1, the word for God is Elohim. As we looked at, it's plural. There's the hint of the Trinity in it that even rabbis saw until Jesus came on earth and that they shut it down. They're wanting to talk about that possibility. But thank you, Lord, that there are three, Father, Son, and Spirit, and have been there from the beginning. Amen.

The word used in Genesis 1 is Elohim, the God of power and creativity and of might. What we saw there was His creating us first a world of abundance and beauty meant to be a sanctuary of His presence, which it will be with the new heavens and the new earth where heaven and earth intersect and the Lord Himself is there dwelling amongst us face to face. We saw His creating and then creating the apex of His creation, us, male and female, the only human distinction before the fall, so foundational to be able to display our triune God, essentially the same, but with specialties, which we end up seeing in chapter two, that enables love, enables giving and taking, because we're not all the same, and appreciation and a much richer display of our amazing God.

We saw that both men and women are commissioned to rule, to manage, and to be fruitful and multiply, to relate in a way that displays God Himself. That's a signpost of His presence. And that we get to do these in a way that shows forth the living God and His beautiful character. Then in chapter two last week, we saw the up close and personal of backing up to look deeply and in much more detail at the creation of male and female. The word for God is Yahweh, which is His covenant name, His personal name. He's the one that Moses met at the burning bush, "I am." "I am whatever you need. I am." And "I am always what you need." We saw that each one of them, the man and the woman, had their own relationship with God. Each of them woke up to Him. That's essential for a healthy male-female relationship, that each of us have our own relationship with Jesus. We're growing in Him and then can, because of that, have His life within to bring to one another. It's a three-way alliance as the two of us and the Lord. We also saw, though they were essentially the same, chapter two brings out the specialties that each of them were created for in purpose and material and focus, the specialties that make a much richer alliance.

We saw with the man, he had his perfect relationship with God, perfect work with no gophers, no bugs in the computer system, just getting with a passion to develop and work with the creation and move it out to manage it in a way that enables life, not management that controls and kills life, but management that enables life to flourish. We saw that he was the one that the Lord gives the commands to before the woman is ever on the scene. "From every tree, from this abundance of beauty and variety, you may eat, but not from this one tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For in the day you eat of it, dying you shall die," a Hebrew way of underlining that this is very bad news. And then we see the creating of the woman, but first with the purpose statement that she's to be an ally, not just a tag along or a servant, but an ally equal in worth. That word ally is used more often of the Lord Himself in the Old Testament as He comes alongside of us, so it's a high calling. Nothing diminutive about it takes everything that I've got to be a wise and godly ally to Steve, not an adversary, as we'll see tonight.

But He also takes the man through the process of discovering his need for that unique ally, searching through the animal kingdom, getting to know them and their characteristics, naming them accordingly because Hebrew names are not just mnemonics, but it's describing the essence of that being and discovering that there is not one corresponding to him. We talked about how men need to go through that in our age, not just with animals, but with buddies, men and women, companionship. But it's important that they come to the point of really knowing their need to value and welcome an ally who is equal in worth to join with them in their calling from the Lord.

We serve the Lord together as allies in the Grand Three-Way Alliance with the Lord Himself. We saw so much last week and it was very good, as the Lord Himself said, and we left them naked and not ashamed, the description of total intimacy, no need to hold anything back out of fear of judgment on the closest of unity, which Jesus raised for us now, post-fall, that we would be one as He and the Father are one in His high priestly prayer in John 17.

There's something that I don't think we mentioned at the end of Genesis 2 that I want to be sure to include: "For this cause, a man shall leave his father and mother, and the two shall become one flesh." We don't get the implications of the term flesh there because there's always a problem in translation. Languages do not correspond to each other one-to-one. Vocabulary is not just familiar. I think all of you have done some work in foreign languages, and you pick up language X, language Y dictionary, and every one of the entries has a huge amount of possibilities in the other language.

Flesh is one of those that doesn't correspond directly between Hebrew and English. Flesh does mean what we generally use it to mean, living tissue, or even butchered meat, but there is a much broader meaning. It's a phenomenon in almost all languages, perhaps all, that the most fundamental terms are verbs. Then nouns are derived from verbs and so on for the various parts of speech. But the verb is seen as being really the root meaning. The use of flesh as a verb, to flesh, which we don't say in English, is very significant because it has the meaning to proclaim news, and more specifically, good news.

When we recognize that, the two shall become one flesh. We are created as incarnations of God's image. We are living representations of God in a form that can be comprehended in an earthly setting. The animals can get it. Other people can get it. In fact, that's in that threefold statement: "God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created him. Male and female, he created them." So man, capital M, God's proper name, and it's God's name for the human race, applies to both male and female human beings. It is not gender exclusive. It is not human gender connected at all. It's all of us.

With the three ways our being living images of God, particularly being created in God's image has to do with our relationship with God, our relationship to all observers, animals, other people. Then thirdly, our relationship to each other. With a married couple, the alliance of the two of them, which really is an alliance of three, just like the Godhead, because marriage is intended to be a relationship of the Lord God, a man, and a woman in covenant relationship. The relationship between them, the visible observation of a married couple, should communicate a great deal about God, about the true God. It expresses God's relational nature and especially God's love in a very powerful graphic way. We see it only after the fall, so we see it only partially. With the first couple, it was fully there. It wasn't very developed yet, I'm sure. We see this develop over the years with a married couple where their marriage is centered in and under the lordship of Jesus. The term flesh gives us a clue that a married couple should express God uniquely in a way that proclaims a very particular good news available to all people. The witness to God in a godly marriage is a very powerful thing. And as Erica noted, of all the distinctives or distinctions between any two individual human beings, there is only one that is so fundamental as to be part of being created in God's image. And that's gender. It is given to us as a wondrous opportunity to express God.

What we're going into tonight introduces the extreme challenges of doing that well in this world because we don't live in the perfect world that the first couple lived in. We don't know for how long. Just give a very quick example of what Steve was talking about, about how even post-fall, a couple where it's a strong three-way alliance of the Lord and the two of them, and each of them growing and displaying, bringing the Lord's beautiful character to each other and then together to others, that it telegraphs the presence of the living God, especially post-fall because people don't expect it.

One quick example from our lives, many of you know, I just about died giving birth to our third almost 30 years ago. Bled massively and shouldn't have a mind, shouldn't be here at all. But the Lord wasn't done with me. Toward the end of that week, one of the nurses was in my room and they all called me the bleeding lady. She said, we all figured (meaning all the nurses) that you and Steve are on your second marriage. I said, oh, really? What makes you think that? She said, because of how tenderly Steve cares for you. And I said, well, actually, at that point, we're well over 20 years and we have had plenty of growth issues, but we've done it on our knees with the Bible open. And Jesus has radically changed both of us and we needed it. She said, I knew it. Now I know why anytime I have free time, I want to do my charting in your room because there's a peace and a joy here that I don't experience anywhere else.

It turned out she and her husband were seekers and had tried out various churches and felt comfortable or welcome. And so I got to tell her about a church near where they lived. She said, oh, you're the second person who has told me about that church. We will need to go. It was the care, the love, the care for one another that telegraphed the Lord's presence, and it didn't take perfect to do that. That's what the Lord loves to do post-fall. What we look at tonight is what went wrong. If we took chapters one, two, and three out of the Bible, life would not make sense as we see it. Chapter three tells us what went desperately wrong and the deep impact that it has had on relationships between men and women, human relationships in general, and also our management or poor management of animals, the earth, et cetera. The reason to go into this is not to bury ourselves in bad news, but to understand the context we live in so that we can be redemptive.

With each section that we look at tonight, we will note how understanding this can be very redemptive in staying on top of it with the Lord instead of being had by it and continuing the evil of the fall in our own lives and our impact on others. Tonight should be very redemptive, not just all bad news.

**Genesis 3**

We start with the temptation. As we look at it, be listening for understanding the way that Satan tempts all of us because he has not had to change his game plan because it works. As we understand it, we can recognize it and stay above it. Paul in 2 Corinthians actually talked about that in 2 Corinthians 2:11, "In order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes." There's a description here and we'll be noting elements of it so that you can note it when it's coming at you and are able to stay above it with the Lord instead of be had and help others as well.

Then we'll be looking at the Lord's redemptive work after we as the human race did go for it. We pick up in Genesis 3:1, "The serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made." There's a connection between Genesis 2:24-25. The previous verse was, "And they were naked and unashamed." Immediately we have a serpent who was more crafty. There's a connection there. There's a pun in the Hebrew. Puns in the Bible, which is full of puns, but usually they're not humorous puns, they're instructive puns. Naked (arom), crafty (arum), same consonants, same basic spelling but one of the vowels different, and it illustrates the fact that the tempter did not come in being radically different. He came in a way that would seem very familiar. They were familiar with animals. He takes an animal form. He is not essentially an animal. He's a spirit, but is able, of course, with the Lord's permission, to take on a physical form for this purpose, which actually does accomplish the Lord's purposes. He's more crafty than any beast in the field, which the Lord God had made. He comes as one of the animals, but he's distinct in actually a very dangerous way. And he said to the woman, "Indeed, has God said, you should not eat from any tree of the garden?" And the woman said to the serpent, "From the trees of the garden we may eat. But from the fruit of the tree, which is in the middle of the garden, God has said you should not eat from it or touch it, or you'll die."

This animal doesn't seem to be very surprised that the animal is speaking, but that may have been a totally new thing, but no reason to suspect that this wasn't just some new phenomenon that they hadn't come across yet. Seemingly asking merely for information, as though they wanted a clarification. "Do I understand this right?"

The Hebrew insight, the word for "any" and "every" is the same term. So, you should not eat from any tree in the garden. Is there any tree you shouldn't eat from? Or it may also be, as God said, you should not eat from every tree in the garden. Every tree that was pleasing to the sight, good for food, except for one. Infinity minus one. Still infinity. And of course, there weren't an infinite number, but still, for all practical purposes, that same principle.

If you've got everything but one, you've got virtually everything, and you can focus on that. Is there really an exception to this wonderful abundance that you're enjoying? She just gives a matter of fact response. She knows that there is a limitation and she mentions it. She doesn't describe it exactly the way God described it to her husband. She doesn't describe it as the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But she knows which tree it is. The tree that's in the middle of the garden.

There's a little male-female tweet to this thing. She is not answering in functional identification, but in relational identification. It's that tree that's in the middle of the garden. She knows what tree it is, and she's referring to it in a perfectly normal way, but it doesn't contain all the information. She knows which tree, and she knows which one not to eat from.

It's interesting, though she does say something that does depart significantly from what the Lord told the man. How does she know it? The Lord gave the information to him for both of them, for all people. But this, or touch it, that's definitely a departure from what God actually said. Where does that come from? We don't know for sure, and the text does not tell us.

Bible texts contain everything we need to know about what it's talking about, but they also contain some little hints at other things and some little puzzles, which helps us really to want to dig in deeper in Scripture. The logical question is, where did this come from or touch it? Speculation, of course, but it seems to us that most likely, though God didn't say don't touch it, her husband did. The scenario may well have gone that the man was showing her the abundance, and this is all just wonderful. However, there's one exception, and you need to know about it. And I'm sure he told her that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but that didn't really mean anything to her. What she connected with because they didn't know the difference between good and evil because everything they encountered was good. And so that may not have seemed significant to her. The important thing was don't eat from this tree.

Naturally, she would wonder, "why? What is it about this tree?" And she almost certainly would have started to move in to try to examine it closely to answer that question. And that's the point at which it makes complete sense that he would say, "don't even touch it!" If you don't touch it, you're not going to eat the fruit, and we're not going to die. They had no experience with death yet. But it's something that was important enough that God warned against it. They knew it was not somewhere they should go, that they wanted to go.

It's how law works, that God has said no to something. So we're going to put some extra hedges around it so we don't get near it. And those become absolutes as well, what the Jews became. That's endemic to rabbinical teaching. They're trying to be really diligent and keep people busy, guard people against doing things that were not okay with God. They started considering, "what could that possibly include?" If we exclude more than necessary, we've excluded what is essential to exclude. But if we don't exclude something that is part of what this is worrying about, then there will be bad consequences. So don't work on the Sabbath. Well, it's to be a day of rest. The point is not that they went beyond the resting to, "don't do any work". What's work? Well, it's really don't do any laborious work. It doesn't mean, but they sort of say, "well, you pick up a spoon to stir your coffee. You're doing work by lifting it up". I didn't think they had physics down to that sophisticated level yet. But that technically is work. So that's where we got this, build a hedge around it. Make sure you don't get hurt.

Now, the tempter says to the woman, "You surely will not die." Direct contradiction of God's warning. "For God knows." Now we've escalated from direct contradiction to, why would God say something that's not true? "He knows in the day you eat from it, your eyes will be open. You will be like God or God's knowing good and evil." Oh, so now we move to why would God say something that was not true? So inference is don't trust God. You'll lose out on something absolutely spectacularly wonderful if you trust God. And very suddenly, "trust me instead".

When the woman saw that the tree was good for food... Is that true? Well, Genesis 2 tells us. God planted every tree that is pleasing to the sight and good for food. "Good for food" is what we're told verbatim. "And that it was a delight to the eyes." Go back to Genesis 2. It says "Pleasing to the sight" (Genesis 2:9) Pleasing to the sight and delight to the eyes... it's similar but not the same. And "desirable to make one wise". This is pragmatically wise, like successful. "This is you do this to succeed. God doesn't want you to succeed in becoming like Him", which is a flat-out contradiction because God created us to be like Him.

When she saw the tree was good for food, delight to the eyes, this term, pleasing to the sight, is aesthetically pleasing. A little more specific translation is that it was dazzling to the eyes. Mesmerizing. Way beyond merely being pleasant to see. One was spot on. The second one was sort of the same. The third one, there's no antecedent. The evil one uses this ploy all the time in slipping counterfeits our way. Start with something that is unquestionably true, then take something that has a familiar ring to it. It may not be exactly the same as what we already know for a fact. Having gained confidence, slip something in that we have no way to evaluate except, well, this guy seems to have been right. Two out of three is not bad. It wasn't really two out of three. It was kind of one and a half out of three.

The issue with counterfeits is that they are not the real thing. A counterfeiter wants to gain an unfair advantage by passing something off as being valuable that, in fact, is not. It's not the genuine thing. They try to make it as much like the real thing as possible and limit the differences from the real thing to things that hopefully are small enough to seem insignificant and to be overlooked. People who are to handle money and need to spot counterfeit bills are never shown a counterfeit. Never. They are shown the real thing in extreme detail and over and over so they really come to know the real thing so thoroughly that when a counterfeit comes into their hands, they spot the departure from the real thing. They spot the error very quickly.

That is helpful to us. The way not to be taken in by the arch deceiver, the evil one in this world, is to get to know the real thing very deeply. The real thing is God's word, God's written word. The better we get to know God's written word, the better we are able to discern what is truly an opportunity for life and what's a trap, leading to some form of death.

When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, a delight to the eyes, and desirable to make one wise, she took from its fruit and ate. "See, good, take" is the classic sequence in walking by sight that is a transgressing what God says because something else looks better. And we find this pattern throughout Scripture, many times. "See, good, take", including David with Bathsheba. There are numerous instances.

Now, she took from its fruit and ate, and she gave to her husband with her. Now, it's very clear the interaction that's recorded here up to this point is between the serpent, the evil one appearing in the form of a serpent, and the woman. We can infer that Adam was not present during that conversation. But we know he was with her when she ate. And he didn't do anything. It was his job to see that they didn't. The Lord charged him with seeing to it that they did not eat the fruit from that tree. To cultivate and keep, to guard from their own choice. It was to serve the garden and guard the garden from departure from God's instructions. But "she gave to her husband with her, and he ate."

There may have been a deception there in that Adam didn't see any harm come to her in eating from the fruit. However, he knew that God said not to eat it. As we find in 1 Timothy 2:14, "Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression." Her transgression, her stepping over the line, was not an act of willful disobedience. His was. Even if he was deceived into thinking it wouldn't have the consequence that God said, he still knew that he was violating God's instruction and warning. 1 Timothy 2:14 says that she was deceived and he was not. He willfully disobeyed. It wasn't that she didn't cross the line. She did, and with big consequences. But she thought she was choosing something good. When she did it, she was deceived.

And part of that may have been her specialty: promoting life, quality of life, and this seemed like an opportunity for that.

And that's why the tempter went to her, not to him, because he wanted to appeal to the one that he could draw away from her knowledge of what God had said and who had it second hand. "She gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Then the eyes of both of them were opened".

It's interesting. Her eyes were not open from eating because she did not disobey willfully. She didn't see things differently as a result of what she did. But when he ate, and the Lord's commandment to the man was, "You shall not eat from it." Now it's not that it didn't apply to her. It did. But the Lord put the responsibility on him. And it's when he ate that then the eyes of both of them were opened. They were open before, of course, to take in physical sight. But now the eyes are becoming agents of other information other than about the physical world. The eyes of both of them were open. They knew they were naked. They'd been naked and unashamed.

Shame in this idiom is not a matter of personal embarrassment, which is the way it is with typically Western culture people. It's not a matter of damaging the name or reputation of the family or social group. It's being defeated. It's military, it's warfare. They were naked in their shame. They had not been conquered. They had not been defeated. They were free to do whatever. So they knew they were naked. They sewed fig leaves together, made themselves loin coverings. Very interesting.

Now, of course, they used a very temporary medium and they needed to have these aprons of fig leaves. They'd be remaking them at least every couple of days. But the important thing is, why did they make a loin covering? Why didn't they run down to Safeway, get some grocery bags, and put bags over their heads? And not just because there was no Safeway at that point. Why didn't they cover their heads? Why didn't they cover their eyes? Why the genital region? Deep, deep revelation of the significance of this. They're now ashamed, but it's not just ashamed of physical nakedness. They don't want to be exposed, and specifically, they know what the function and effect of the genitals is.

In chapter four, we'll get the term, you know, Adam knew his wife Eve as the biblical euphemism for that had sexual relations with her. There's a deep hint at what sex is all about. It's to enter into a very deep knowledge of one another in a way that it cannot be acquired any other way. Every married couple knows that in the times that they are celebrating their marriage physically, sexually, at the point of climax, there is an extreme openness and ability to see into each other. We talk about the eyes being the window on the soul because it's generally recognized that a lot can be seen in someone's eyes, which is really interesting because we don't see anything physical in their eyes, but it's an experience of being able to see very deeply into each other, and that is wonderful for two who are becoming one in all ways. It's not something wonderful with a number of people. But this is specifically God's intent for marriage. They knew and remembered their marriage relationship was perfect, not in the sense of mature. We don't know how long they lived before the tempter showed up and the fall came. But they suddenly knew they didn't want to be seen. They didn't want to be exposed because suddenly there's something they don't want others to know. This is new. They heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. God will confirm later toward the end of this chapter that the man, behold, in verse 22, the man has become like one of us. Both of the things that the tempter promised are actually true. This shows the deception because God knows the day you eat from it, your eyes will be opened. That's confirmed later on. Their eyes were opened. "You'll be like God, knowing good and evil." That's also confirmed later on.

Good is that which enables and engenders life, and evil is that which destroys life. They're deciding now by sight, not by listening to the Lord for what leads to long-term forms of death, what leads to long-term forms of life. They're deciding by sight. That's how all of us operate naturally, that we have the sense that I can size things up myself. Most all of us are trained in fine point analysis. There's the sense that "I can look, I can observe, I can analyze, and I can come up with what's really going on or what I should do". It's human arrogance because we never see all of the parameters and we can't see where things will go for the long run. Only the Lord, who's the Creator and outside of time, can see that.

Let's just look for a moment at the method that the adversary used. As we noted at the beginning, he has not had to change his game plan because it still works. There are numbers of elements that he uses as a standard approach. As Paul said in 2 Corinthians 2:11, "that no advantage be taken of us by Satan, for we're not ignorant of his schemes."

What have we seen here? First of all, he's coming in acting like someone under them who's just a friend. He's one of the animals under them. There are times when people who are even good friends, they may even be mature believers, but not in this case. We can all be mature in some areas and not in others. A counselor, a pastor, someone in your family, people even with the best of intent can offer and urge things that if we are wise, we step back to say, "Lord, what do you say about this in Your word? Is there anything You say?
