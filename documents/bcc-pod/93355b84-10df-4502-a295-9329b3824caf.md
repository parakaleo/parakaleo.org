> Oh, Lord, thank you that you are wherever in the world each of us are. Thank you that we belong to you. Thank you that no matter what the circumstances, you are good and you accomplish so much in us and through us and for us, even in the midst of circumstances we would never choose. Lord, thank you for Paul, for all that he trusted you for and how you use this one man to open up the Roman Empire to you in so many ways, following in the steps of Jesus. And Lord, use us where you have planted each of us. Lord, open our ears to hear you, our eyes to see you. Help us to hear the things that are especially for each one of us, as well as for others that we'll have the opportunity to encourage. And Lord, we are so thankful for each one here, so loved by you and by us as well. And Lord, we ask for encouragement tonight and vision of how to walk with you in all seasons. In your name, amen. 

**Introduction**

Welcome. As you know, if you read the announcement, we're starting in Philippians 1:12. We're now looking at Paul sharing his circumstances. These are circumstances that he would never have chosen himself. He describes himself as a prisoner of Christ Jesus, not of other people, but he is in a long period of circumstances not being the way that he would have engineered them. There are those seasons in each of our lives where our scenario is not what is playing out. It rarely does, right? But here in particular, it's for a man who we know was active, walked thousands of difficult miles to reach those who had never heard the gospel. He's been imprisoned now for years. First, of course, in Philippi, then in Caesarea Maritima for years, and then having appealed to Caesar now in Rome. The Romans were "kind"; they would provide the housing, but you or your friends had to provide everything else. If you were a citizen, you had the right to one meal a day, but it wasn't always forthcoming. It was dependent on your friends whether you would have food to eat as you were being imprisoned. Paul has been in prison, and he doesn't know whether it will end in death or release. He's giving us a glimpse over his shoulder of how to handle these seasons when things are exactly the way we never wanted them to be.

**How to live in the midst of circumstances we didn't ask for**

This isn't just through seasons of imprisonment, though we know people, as we taught in Romania, who were imprisoned for years in dark, horrible Romanian prisons just because they were preaching Jesus. It also can be through other circumstances that we would never choose, like illness. We've walked with various former students and friends, alongside them, as they deal with cancer and the pain, the uncertainty, that "it wasn't supposed to be this way" feeling, and then learning how to walk it with the Lord the way that Paul does here. There are many such situations within the body of Christ as well as outside. We'll be looking at how to handle situations when they are the opposite of what we would have written in. What is the Lord doing, and how do we walk through this? Many of you have been on short-term mission trips. What is the thing that people heading out on such trips usually fail to anticipate? Everyone focuses on the needs of the target beneficiaries and preparing for that and understanding as much as possible about the culture and the situations and the spiritual conditions that they expect to find. But the thing that trips  up many mission teams is that they forget to anticipate and prepare for spiritual attacks in the form of conflict within the team. It happens every time. Wise leaders recognize this as a necessary part of the venture. This is how God works to get the team to focus on Him and address issues in their own lives to be better equipped to minister to the target beneficiaries.

Paul sees this sort of thing, and we'll explore that more. We expect to go through verse 20 tonight as we did last night with the students on campus. The benefits we glean from these nine verses are special and valuable. Though tightly related, what begins in verse 21 will focus us on a second aspect. It's important to keep this first aspect clearly in view and benefit from it tonight, and then next week we'll address the rest.

Let's read through. If someone would like to read, go ahead. Assume you received the reminder email with the attachment of the text we'll be using tonight. We don't say this is the text, but this is the one we'll be working from tonight, which is our translation. For your own purposes, use whatever translation you find helpful. All translations have certain advantages and disadvantages. 

> Now I will you to know, brethren, that my circumstances are contributing to the progress of the good news, so as to make my fetters and the cause of Christ manifest in all the praetorium and hence to everyone else. My fetters thus persuading the majority of the brethren in Christ to dare more abundantly to speak the word fearlessly. Some proclaiming Christ from envy and strife, but others from goodwill. The latter out of love, knowing that I'm placed here for the defense of the good news. The former proclaim Christ not sincerely, but out of rivalry, supposing to arouse distress by my fetters. What then? Only that in every manner, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in this I rejoice, and I will yet rejoice. For I know that, via your prayers and the promise of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, this shall come out for me unto salvation. According to my eager expectation and hope, that I shall not be put to shame in anything, but with all boldness, even now as always, Christ shall be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death. 

One thing that's helpful to know is that in the ancient world, as is frequent now, if someone's imprisoned, whether it was just or not, they're viewed as shameworthy and people tend to want to keep them at a distance. One of the questions for tonight is how did the Philippians view Paul's imprisonment? After all, he was imprisoned in their own city, and then again in Caesarea Maritima and now in Rome. It would be easy for them to separate themselves from him and not want to mix their reputation with him. How do the Philippians view him and how do we know? How does Paul view his imprisonment, these unjust circumstances that he would never have chosen?

He planned to go to Rome, but really to encourage the church in Rome. We know that from the letter of Romans. He planned to go, but he never envisioned going as a prisoner. The Lord didn't let him go until he had written to the church that he had not founded and had never visited, but had only heard about. It's because of that he didn't have the insights into their specific needs as distinct from the needs of other churches. He wound up writing them a systematic treatise on the Christian life, starting from the legacy from the fall and the downward spiral of sin, of God's wrath, God's letting us exercise our own free will and see where it leads, hopefully realizing our need for Him, and then how God reaches into people and how He saves people, how He brings people to faith using Abraham as the example.

Romans 5 to 8 is the systematic explanation of how the process of working out your salvation and practice works and how to cooperate with it and benefit from it. Then moving into how to apply the results, the ministering to others, which is handled relatively briefly, because the point is the individual Christian life. We have the letter because the Lord wouldn't let Paul go until he wrote it. There is an example there of God using the circumstances. Paul didn't understand why he couldn't seem to get to Rome. That is a helpful testimony to us about the significance of circumstances that we see as quite evidently, even seemingly obviously interfering with what God wants to do in our lives and do through us, especially when we're setting out on some mission of some sort.

**Response to Paul's Imprisonment**

How do we know how the Philippians are viewing Paul? Normally people in that culture would have looked at him as someone they wanted to distance themselves from because of his imprisonments. This is a reminder of the value when we're studying through a book of Scripture, but this is simply a letter. It was written as a continuous letter. There are no chapter divisions. There weren't even verse numbers. It's important as we're studying that periodically to reread the whole thing. As we read the whole thing, the significance of what we're looking at at the moment will become much deeper and broader. What do we know from the letter to the Philippians about their regard for Paul and the significance of his imprisonments? There are two reactions, but whether they are the right motivation or not, they are choosing to proclaim the gospel, and that's what Paul's happy about. Those are Roman believers with him in Rome.

We've already seen in verse seven from last week, Paul saying that both in his imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, they are partakers in fellowship, koinonia, of grace with him. They are sharing in God's favor with his imprisonment as well as in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.

If you turn to the end of Philippians, the last section starting in verse 10 is a thank you letter from Paul for the provision they sent for him as he's in prison in Rome. He says in verse 10 of chapter four, "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at last you revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned before, but you lacked opportunity."

Later on, he says in verse 15, "You yourselves know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but you alone. For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my needs." It's clear that his imprisonment in Philippi did not deter them at all. They were tracking where he was and sending support so that he was freed up from tent making, which is what he did to support himself and his companions.

We talk about tent making missions. That's where it comes from, that Paul and several of his ministry companions were literally tent makers, and tents were very important those days because a lot of people lived in them at least a significant part of the time, if not all the time, and so that's how they supported themselves when they didn't have gift support donations to free them up from having to do that. So that's how they would self-fund. That's where we get the idea of a tent making missionary.

We know that the Philippians stood with him all the way and participated and were in fellowship with him in all that he was doing. The term koinonia means literally commonality, sharing in things we have in common. 

**How does Paul view his own imprisonment?**

How does Paul view what he would certainly never have chosen? The active man who loved to be hiking and be let off when the ship was unloading and meet you at the next port. He got relief from the people he was stuck with on the boat. He had hours to meditate on Scripture that he'd memorized and to pray—a time apart with the Lord.

Here he is, having traveled thousands of miles, much of it on foot over rugged conditions. He was used to being free and able to do that. I can relate to that as a distance runner who's now run the equivalent of more than two and a half times around the equator. Running is an important part of my life. This made me think of the distress I had during the time I was in peak running condition when I had to have eye surgery and be hospitalized. I remember looking out the window, knowing that for the first day in over a thousand days, I was not going to run. Here's Paul, used to trekking huge mileage routinely, and he can't go anywhere. He hasn't been able to for years because of being imprisoned. I can appreciate what that would be like, and I'm glad I haven't been put in that situation.

**Paul's focus: What is the Lord doing?**

How is Paul viewing all this? Where is Paul's complaint about not being able to go hiking? He says that his circumstances are contributing to the progress of the good news. He's got his attention on his confidence in more important things. What is the Lord accomplishing that would be unlikely if Paul had gotten to Rome as a free man, as he had planned to? What about verse 13? What's the significance of what he refers to here? Is it because he can interact with other prisoners and the guards and people who wouldn't ordinarily cross paths with if he were a free man?

**What the Lord is doing: in the Roman Empire**

Exactly. And in all the praetorium, what's the praetorium? It is a location—Caesar's Palace. The Praetorian Guard is the counterpart to the U.S. Secret Service Presidential Protection Division. They were the personal bodyguards of Caesar and the things he cared about. Praetorium was not his palace, but it was a kind of military headquarters for Caesar. These were the elite, many of them sons of noblemen—the elite of the elite of the Roman military, which was quite an operation. He, as a political prisoner of Rome and of Caesar, was under house arrest, not in a prison at that point. Later, he was in the Mertini prison, a dungeon, but not yet. He was chained to two of the Praetorian Guard every four hours, who switched to keep him from going anywhere.

"He who sits in the heavens laughs, the Lord scoffs at them." The purpose of Paul's chains was known to the Lord and Paul, who was chained to the original captive audience. Paul shared the gospel, and his fetters in the cause of Christ were manifest in all the praetorium. He had been there long enough for them to have had time with him or heard about it.

At the end of Philippians, Chapter 4, verse 22, "All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household." The Lord used Paul's imprisonment to spread the gospel into Caesar's household, which would have been unlikely if he arrived in Rome a free man. Imagine the irony of dragging somebody in who, unbeknownst to you, is the principal agent of the enemy political country and placing them in the midst of government operations.

Paul appealed to Caesar and would have presented the gospel to Nero, one of the most despicable people who've ever lived who delighted in torching Christians for his garden parties and was just perverse and cruel in every way. Yet the Lord cared enough about him for him to be able to hear the gospel, to have a chance. Because of Paul's imprisonment and Roman citizenship, we are confident he presented the gospel during his defense of the charges against him.

Paul's circumstances turned out for the further progress of the good news, reaching the heart of the Roman Empire and Caesar's household. The Lord accomplished much, and Philippi, where many of the Praetorian guard retired, would have heard the news. As we influence people, we never know how many waves it starts to others.

He mentions others as well, to everyone else. Who is the everyone else? Maybe the household of Caesar. We know that for sure. Who else might it include, looking at the text we just read? I would just think of other people in the household. You have the guards, but there would be people serving them, making food, doing who knows what else in Caesar's guard place or whatever. Just other people that would be in that world that he would be encountering.

He's not in the praetorium. We know he's under house arrest somewhere. People came and went because groups of Jews were able to meet with him. He presented the gospel to them. The idea is other people too. 

**Example: Missionaries in the Congo**

It's helpful to realize that this isn't just an isolated event in history. This is a very prominent example of what the Lord does routinely. Even to some things of somewhat lesser, but still quite extreme possibilities, like Erica's high school classmate, who's been a lifelong missionary in Africa with her husband and who, during a revolution in which their son told us they thought they were just firecrackers going off. Actually, it was bullets. The kids were asleep and thought, okay, somebody's having a celebration.

Under those circumstances, she went on two different occasions to rather irresponsible, if not perverse, military leaders of the city and presented them with Scripture. They were serving in, I can't think of the name of the country at the moment, but a revolution was just about to happen. The few missionaries... Congo. Few missionaries left, and they were praying, and it became clear. The Lord said that my friend should go to the military head of the city. She knew that this happened on two different occasions. One time the character was known as the Hitler of Bunia. And you go to him and talk to him.

She was somehow able to get an audience with him, and she asked him to read an excerpt from Jesus' trial. And he did. Surprisingly enough, reading about Pilate's handling, she said, "Sir, this man was charged with keeping the peace and justice, and he failed on both accounts. Are you about to do the same thing?" The Lord got through, and he was both of the occasions to the two different leaders that the Lord sent her to. One of them she got to lead to the Lord, and the other one didn't come to the Lord, but when the revolution actually happened that night and the kids thought there were firecrackers going off when indeed it was bullets through the window, that leader sent a helicopter to fly them out at midnight. Get their family out. The Lord uses all of us in strategic ways. Your comment, Cora, that others are around and watching is always the case with all of us. People watch people. You are watched far more than you know, not to make you uncomfortable. Who knows who we're influencing? We think we lead our private lives and nobody notices. After all, when we're out, we're just one of us. I've had various people over the years come up and say, "I've been watching you for years. You know, walk your dog and so on." And I'm thinking, what did you see? It's people watch people. How we handle what we're given becomes a stage for the Lord.

**Changing our focus in practice**

Here, as Paul is given circumstances that he would certainly never have chosen personally. He's out of control of pretty much all of it. There are times where there are very few parameters that we can control. We hate those situations. Major illness is one of those. Walked with various dear friends, former students, various ones through cancer and so on. Terminal. They don't know how it's going to play out. Like Paul, I don't know whether this latest round is going to issue in more life or death. It was not my plan. The question is, a lot of the parameters are out of my control, but what is always under my control? How I deal with it. Where my focus is.

That's the key with Paul. I doubt he arrived at this instantly, knowing what a strong personality he was. His statement when the chief priest, high priest had him slapped on the cheek for saying that he'd been true in his faith. Paul's response is, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall." He's a strong guy, and he has strong opinions, but you know you talked that way to the high priest. "Oh, I didn't realize he was high priest because they traded off and bought it from the Romans." I doubt he arrived at this instantly. He came to this realization. He backed off to what is the Lord doing. Cora touched on the topic of people in menial positions and those with terminal cancer in hospitals. Many of you have been praying for someone in such a situation and witnessed how the Lord worked. The patient who viewed the hospital not as a horrible prison due to their medical condition but as an outpost for the gospel, an opportunity to love people who are constantly around those who are so hurting that they can't even possibly think about anyone else's welfare. When caregivers and medical teams encounter someone, who at their absolute worst, is intent on their well-being, not their own, it stands out. This includes medical physicians, support staff, technical workers, and janitors. And people who come in to clean the room or bring food or take out the dirty dishes, etc. When someone genuinely inquires about their well-being, not just being polite or cordial; it really stands out. A lot of them come to understand what is behind that amazing love for people who are generally just used by people under those same circumstances, but who don't have this resource welling up in them and expressed through them so beautifully.

It's easy to feel sorry for yourself, to be angry and frustrated, where the whole focus is: "This wasn't my plan, I didn't want this", and "poor me", or "I am so angry." But we are telegraphing to others how to handle life. Paul has worked through this and realized his circumstances were a platform for the Lord to show Himself, and that's always true for every one of us. It's a good reminder.

Often, when frustrated, we don't know what else to do, and it seems rational to be upset. These lessons have shown there's a rational way to respond—Christ in us. This has helped me in new situations recently, to remember to respond to people as a work in progress, not someone I'm entitled to judge or be mad at. That's the work of the Spirit in me, as my nature is not to do that. I really appreciate it. Being reminded of how we can respond helps us become the person we truly want to be. We don't like ourselves when we act otherwise. 

It's easy to focus on the injustice, but that doesn't solve anything because it is a broken world. How do we deal with the brokenness in a way that joins the Lord in His work?

**What the Lord is doing: opportunities for others to use their gifts**

Paul brings up another aspect of what he sees the Lord doing: overcoming the intimidation factor of prominent figures in the Lord's work. Paul realizes that someone who casts a big shadow can eclipse others, intimidating them from exercising their gifts, learning to minister to others, growing, and participating. It's wonderful and gracious when people in prominent positions encourage others to take responsibility and commend them and don't just keep playing the big cheese role.

Paul sees that by being sidelined, people are finding the courage to step into the gap left by his absence. Verse 14 states, "His fetters are persuading the majority of the brethren in Christ to dare more abundantly to speak the word fearlessly." There are several reasons for this. One is that the big guy is no longer able to go out and do it, giving others a chance to step forward and use their gifts.

**What the Lord is doing: hope for victorious life even in the worst-case scenarios**

Another reason is the boldness people gain from seeing Paul in prison and how he handles it. If they feared imprisonment themselves, seeing whatever they were afraid of not happening to him, partly because he's able to respond to it in submission to the Lord, helps them not be afraid of it. We saw and learned from people in the Soviet bloc who gave testimony to being encouraged and emboldened to step out when they saw others imprisoned for their faith and how the Lord sustained them. They overcame their fear of arrest and imprisonment by facing the worst-case scenario, realizing it wasn't the end of the story. Paul is aware that his situation could end in execution, and eventually, it did. But he is not stopped by that worst-case scenario. It's easy for us with a large fear, a real fear, to be caught in it. "I don't even want to go there, don't even want to think about it or deal with it, and I back away from it". But instead of backing away, "what is the worst-case scenario?". "How would the Lord view that?" 

Paul says whether by death or life, I want Jesus to be exalted in his body. It's not the worst-case scenario; it's just where I get to serve. And the focus is that Christ be shown throw me, whatever I'm called to do. And we saw that in Romania. "We've been told the secret police have many very thick dossiers on us. But we just keep proclaiming the gospel because as long as the Lord wants us free, they can't touch us. When the Lord wants to imprison us or end our life, then we can't protect ourselves. We know our calling now is to proclaim the Lord."

And there were believers, pastors, grabbed off the street and imprisoned in solitary for 16 years. But he ended up writing the psalms of the Romanian people on little scraps of anything he could write on. Thousands of hymns that eventually then got published here, because Orthodox Church wanted to destroy them because they were evangelical. But PBC Cupertino got a hold of them, published thousands and thousands of copies here. There's no way they can wipe that out. And the Lord has the last word. 

But the beautiful thing is, as we see people like Paul, like Traian Dorz, like others who head into a worst-case scenario and know: "Okay, Lord, thank you. This is what you called me to. May you be exalted in my body and through me, no matter what the circumstances are". And the powerful platform that they have that influences people way beyond their lifetime. Traian Dorz is home with the Lord now. So is Paul. But we know about them and are encouraged. 

Bringing this also back to contemporary applications, we asked various of the believing friends that we got to know in Eastern Europe for guidance on handling persecution because they had handled it so well and they had triumphed in the face of persecution. And we know that for decades, believers who were in the whole Soviet network have been praying for persecution for the church in the West so that we will get serious about our faith. I'm praying that we won't need that. We asked them for guidance, and you know what they said? "Oh, that's no problem. We need to have you teach us how to handle the temptations of prosperity because that's what's coming on us, and we don't know how to handle that materialism". And they were right.

**Verse 18: varying motivations**

Here going on, there's a bifurcation, a splitting between, and these are believers. This is not believers and unbelievers. If we read this carefully, the majority of the brethren in Christ, some proclaiming Christ out of envy and strife. Believers having the Spirit, but preaching the gospel motivated by the flesh and for fleshly reasons. But Paul says, when we get down to verse 18, "What then? Only in every manner, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and this to rejoice, and I will yet rejoice."

We know of instances of unbelievers proclaiming the gospel for various reasons. And the Lord using it. And in some cases, then bringing those unbelievers to actual faith themselves. When I was a student at Stanford, there was a student who was in Europe and ended up at Francis Schaeffer, Francis and Edith Schaeffer's Chalet in Labrie in Switzerland, where that would catch American youth looking for meaning in life, traveling Europe, and he was a Christian philosopher, and many came to the Lord through there at LaBrie. This student was proclaiming the gospel, but was confusing and arguing for it so effectively. But he wasn't a believer, and Francis Schaeffer had to ask him to stop because it was clear he agreed with the philosophy, but had not given his life to the Lord, and that was clear to unbelievers as well as believers. He ended up shadowing me while I was working as a chaplain at Stanford Hospital as part of my human biology degree. Pretty soon, as we met with patients, even if we didn't actually talk about the Lord, he would turn to me afterwards and say, "That person was a Christian with a big C, weren't they?" And not just a Christian with a small C, not just having some church membership. Not just a pew warmer. But he was seeing the Spirit, and he came to the Lord.

But here again, there's a mixed reaction. And this is among real believers, and we get that within the church. It's really important—groups and committees and your situation, Beth, that you're mentioning—same thing. All of us are a mixed bag of the Spirit and still plenty of the flesh left, and it plays out in things to do with the Lord, and it can get really ugly at times. 

**Example: Marcus and Narcissa Whitman**

If you're familiar with the Whitmans, Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, who opened up Oregon to settlers, they were believers. The Nez Perce Indians sent people asking for missionaries to be sent to their tribe. Marcus and Narcissa Whitman and another couple went. In the other couple, the man had wanted to marry Narcissa, but she chose Marcus instead. He got married, but he was bitter. Here are these two couples, a wonderful combination out on the mission field by themselves. The bitter guy and his wife chose the Nez Perce, who were asking for the gospel, and kind of shoved Narcissa and Marcus, her husband—he was a doctor—off to a tribe that was known even among the Native Americans as absolutely treacherous: they could pretend to be friends and then all of a sudden turn vicious.

They lived there, started a mission station, reached out, healed lots of the Native Americans from diseases, just were there loving on people and spreading the gospel. As settlers were coming over into Oregon, they were the first station that welcomed them. This tribe all of a sudden turned vicious and martyred, just completely killed everyone in the mission station, including Marcus and Narcissa. These things get played out, where the flesh in believers can have serious consequences. We could tell you endless stories of that sort of thing, but God, and that's what Paul is doing. It's easy when you see it and it's wrong. You're thinking, "you're believers. What are you doing? This is wrong". All of us have the hope of heaven. We expect that you're a believer. You're going to act like it. We don't always act like it, to be honest. We're all growing up in the Lord. The garbage comes out, and I can either play into it by reacting or, and having far more for the Lord to have to clean up, or as Paul has done, he's backing off. He sees it, he's calling it for what it is, but he's not letting it control him. He is backing off to what is the Lord doing here. "The gospel is being proclaimed even from bad motives." 

Heaven is available to us here and now. Eternal life is intimate relationship with God the Father and God the Son by the agency of the Holy Spirit in us. That is available to us right now. However, the lovely circumstances, peace, quiet, and ease we associate with that are not to be expected in this world. Notice what Paul does not do, which is a huge temptation. Especially young believers, immature believers, and even older, more experienced, genuine believers can fall into this. Our job is not to run around looking for everything wrong with everybody in the church and trying to expunge all of the fleshliness from the church. It's not that we're not to encourage people into the real thing and help them get free of the other, but it is easy to get going on a witch hunt to try to purge the church or the particular Christian association of that which is not from the Lord. If you do that, you wind up eliminating all the people because the flesh is there in everybody.

Where does Paul focus instead? The big danger associated with that happens to prominent people, celebrities, or major political figures who come to the Lord and respond to the gospel. The big temptation for them is to want to use their prominence for the gospel immediately. Bob Dylan made that mistake. When he became a believer, he thought, "Whoa, I'm just going to sweep all of my fans right along with me. They'll just ride my coattails right through the pearly gates." What happened? His fans felt that he had betrayed them because he was the troubadour of ungodly sex, hedonism in modern manifestations.

Eldridge Cleaver, leader of the Black Panthers, came to the Lord and immediately wanted to use his influence for the Lord. He didn't get established in his walk with the Lord first, which he was advised to do, and it failed.

**Our calling regardless of what others are or aren't doing**

The Lord takes responsibility for the fleshliness in individuals, the church, and fellowship groups. Our calling is to keep proclaiming and demonstrating the gospel and encouraging the new life in those who have started in it. The Lord will take care of the rest.

What is always open to me is I can give vision through my own approach to those around me. Even if I see lots of fleshliness, and this plays out in marriages, families, extended families, churches, and work situations, there's a lot that I can't control, even though I would really like to. Of course, they'd like to control me too. But what is always open to me is what I show forth in my life. My life, as a platform, can be a platform of the Lord working redemptively. 

That's what Paul is focusing on in verses 18 through 20. What does he choose to embody? Being very aware of the bad motives, as well as good motives of others. He's aware of a very mixed situation. But instead of letting that grab his whole focus and becoming paralyzed to do anything because of anger, instead he backs off to "What is the Lord doing?" Christ is proclaimed, even if it's in pretense at times. The Lord will use that. We know people who've come to the Lord through totally off-the-wall ministries, but that was the first step toward real faith, and the Lord completes what he begins. 

**Verse 19-20: confident of salvation... from what? **

We need to take a closer look at verse 19. "I know that via your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Christ Jesus, this shall come out for me unto salvation". Now, when he says the provision of the Spirit, he does not mean the Spirit being provided to me. This could well be translated, maybe be better translated, the "provision from the Spirit", that the provision that God provides through the agency of the Holy Spirit. Notice the emphasis here, where you have the spirit of Christ Jesus. Christ: the anointed one, God's anointed one. And Jesus: the personal manifestation as in the incarnation as a human being. This shall come out for me unto salvation.

Paul uses the term salvation with various implications, all related and legitimate. It's easy to assume salvation means coming to faith, but Paul isn't hoping to become a Christian. Many translations use "deliverance" because the word salvation has that implication, especially in a secular context.

What's Paul talking about? The term salvation is used with various implications, all related and all legitimate. Paul uses it in different ways in his letters. But it's very easy, as people would commonly assume in the church, that salvation means coming to faith, asking Jesus into your life. And this would be puzzling since Paul is already a Christian. 

My translation says "deliverance". A lot of translations do, because the word that we normally translate "salvation" has that implication, and that's a legitimate usage of it, especially in a secular context. 

The answer lies in Philippians 2:13, where Paul urges us to "work out our salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is at work in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure." Paul is talking about growth in maturity with the Lord and being saved from the activity of the flesh. It's a wonderfully encouraging statement that Paul himself is eager to be saved even more from who he was naturally into who he now is. 

He is the new already. When he talks about the old man in various ways, he's talking about my former identity, who I was, what kind of a person I was. Once I become a new creature in Christ, he points out in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "everything is new." Bringing my lifestyle, including my thinking, into conformance with who I now am, as opposed to who I was formerly and naturally, is a process that goes on throughout a believer's lifetime. It's very encouraging to see Paul eager for that process to be going on in himself, in his own life, at this stage in his maturity and powerful fruitful ministry.

> Is there a difference between working out salvation and sanctification? 
>
> In essence, no. But in perspective, yes. The process of salvation in practice is the from side of the process of being sanctified, that is becoming more and more holy, more and more God-like in practice. So the sanctification, salvation is the from aspect and sanctification is the to aspect of one in the same process. It's which aspect we are looking at at the moment that makes one or the other term more apropos.

And Paul then kind of summarizes in verse 20 that "Christ shall be exalted in my body, whether through life or through death." You might think he's saying through your prayers and the powerful work of Jesus, I'll be set free. But he's not saying that. He's saying whether in life or in death, the goal is that the Lord be exalted in me, that He's shown forth in a way. So my life becomes a signpost of the living God. That is what is always open to us in any situation, no matter how ugly and how unjust. The thing that I have control of and the place where I can have a very powerful influence that goes way beyond people I'll ever meet is, "Lord, how do I show You forth in these circumstances I would never have chosen?" To put it in spiritual terms, "How can I glorify You?" That's what that means, to glorify Him is to show people what He's really like, which is not what we see most of the time in most people as we observe them. 

How do you translate verse 19: "salvation" or "deliverance"? The downside of translating it as deliverance is it easily leads to the notion that Paul is confident that as they pray and the Spirit works, he will get out of prison. It's definitely not what he's saying. Verse 20 puts the lie to that notion. This is helpful because we will find ourselves throughout our lives in marriages, extended families, church situations, and work situations. We have students where they've got others who are doing mean-spirited competition. We've had students whose research has been stolen and published under the other person's name. It's called scooping. It's common enough in the ugly side of academia that it has a recognized term to describe it. We've known situations of Judas in the lab doing exactly that.

**Working it out in practice: my expectation and hope**

But what's always open to me is how I respond. I get to give vision to everybody in the lab or everybody in the marriage and the extended family, not that I'm above everybody and holier than thou, but just humbly letting the Lord show through me and not reacting. I'm quietly backing off to the Lord, quietly thanking Him. Here we are where I didn't want to be, but thank you for it. Paul says he rejoices in what the Lord is doing, so "Thank you for what You're doing. Some of it I can see possibly. In other parts, I'm not quite sure, but I know You are at work. Help me to grow so that I show You forth in these circumstances. Please use that to give vision to others in the marriage, the family, whatever the church, whatever the setting is." 

And as we pray (and that is within my control) then the Lord can use it massively, and we've seen Him do it again and again. Sometimes it's totally surprising. I've had somebody say, "When you said... and it was 30 years ago, I don't remember at all. But it was something that the Spirit used in tough situations that really gave vision for how it's possible to live above that stuff and be redemptive with the Lord." That perspective is about what I can always expect God to do through me.

The other thing is verse 19 really gives the perspective on what I can expect God to do to me. The key is not putting my hopes in God saving me from death or the circumstances, but God saving me: that is, working out more of my salvation from the life of the flesh into the life of the Spirit through the circumstance. He said, "helping me through your prayers." A lot of times none of us grasp how powerful prayer is. It's not just, "oh, pray for me", but prayer really welcomes the Lord at work as He is eager to do so. As we pray, the Lord goes to work. We have a quote on our refrigerator some of you may have seen. It's from Alfred Lord Tennyson. He says, "More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of." And of course, we know from the end of James, "the prayer of a righteous man avails much," and Elijah is the example. But he's got a nature like ours, so it doesn't need to be perfect life or perfect prayer. The Lord uses our prayers powerfully.

We actually have so many powerful tools at our fingertips for these sorts of situations. We're welcoming the Lord to be at work first in my life, then in the lives of others, leading what He's begun or showing Himself. We get to join the Lord in those prayers. We know from Romans 8:26 that when we're weak, we're prayed for by the Spirit. And then Jesus joins in that in Romans 8:34. We're interceded for.

> Lord, thank you that you are powerfully at work in this world in the midst of all of the brokenness and the mixed motives and the self-interest that shows up in a million ugly forms. Lord, thank you that in the midst of that, you are at work in grace, in love. You provided the way of salvation and showed it in the way you lived in the midst of totally horrible motivations from the religious leadership and many others as well.
>
> Thank you that you used Paul and Lord use us as we're in the midst of real life that we would back off to you with thanksgiving for what you will do through circumstances we would never choose. Welcome your changing us so that you are exalted in our lives, no matter what the circumstances. Use each one of us powerfully. With people we may never meet, we're people that we know well, but they may not share with the impact or it may not bear fruit for a long time. But you sow lots of seeds through our lives and you cause the growth.
>
> Lord, may we keep looking to you to sow good seed, to show it forth, show you forth in our lives. Thank you that you're not calling us to be fake, to plaster on a Christian smile as if everything were perfect. You are realistic about the issues we deal with. Thank you that we get to go to you for work at the very core so that we are growing in your beautiful, strong, redemptive character in the midst of a dark world. Thank you, Lord God, for each one. Strengthen us for where you called us to walk. In your name, amen. Amen. I wanted to thank you guys. I just got back from five days of caring for twins in Spokane. I haven't had much sleep because I helped with night duty, and with two of them, they kept us hopping. Justin is working this week, and it started with his two-day business trip, so he was gone two nights. At night, they have one bassinet on each side of the bed, and each parent is responsible for one of the twins so the other can get some sleep.
