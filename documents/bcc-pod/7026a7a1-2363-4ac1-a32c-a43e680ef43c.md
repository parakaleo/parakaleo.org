> Oh, Lord, thank You we have the reality of You who have always been and always will be—the one on whom we get to build our lives. Thank You that even when many things, maybe all things, change in our lives, You never do. And that's good, Lord. You are our rock, our salvation, our joy. And Lord, thank you that you give us strength and life and even joy in the midst of the challenges of the broken world. Thank you for the privilege of getting to be called and equipped and strengthened to be citizens of heaven, even while we're here on earth.

> Lord, we ask that tonight, as we've all been busy with many things and carrying many concerns, may we entrust all of those to You into Your capable hands and have the refreshment and the joy and the encouragement of learning from You, learning from Your word, which speaks to all cultures of all ages. You speak to the human issues, and thank You that we get to transcend what's purely human as You complete what You've begun while we're still here and very much in process. We're so thankful for each one. Would You please use this for encouragement and equipping for every one of us in Your name, amen.

**Introduction**

As you know, if you had a chance to look even briefly at the last-minute announcement of tonight, we get to look at what, to my mind, is perhaps the apex of Philippians, out of which everything else comes. The key to our life, our joy, our perspective is not burning out in the midst of the challenges of life, the long-term relationships where it's easy to lose perspective and become weary and burn out.

This passage includes really the apex of where we fill up so that we have much to give with the Lord. As we saw in recent weeks, we have started with Paul's example, as he's in the midst of long-term challenges and difficult relationships with believers and unbelievers. There is the other end of the parentheses of the example of Christ dealing with the same things, the challenges of godly people and very ungodly people, people within Judaism who should have recognized him and known better, but who had not prepared themselves where their entire focus was self and self-preservation, self-power, all of that, and dealing with the Romans.

We get a glimpse here of how to build together with other believers, even when we have so many distinctions. The Lord loves variety. Then you add immaturity and sin to that, and unity is not what comes about naturally. We certainly see that in the news, and we see it within churches and families. What the Lord is giving us, inviting us into, is living together in a different way, living as citizens of heaven, living with the high purpose that He gives us no matter what our circumstances are.

**Verse 27: Citizens worthy of the good news of Christ**

There's a lot of riches here that we very much enjoyed with the students last night, and they all said it was terrifically helpful to where they themselves are. It certainly has been for us. We got to Philippians 1:27 after Paul has talked about his feeling torn between going home to be with his Lord after his long and very difficult service, noting that that's very much better than continuing on here on earth. At this point, he is imprisoned and staying here and living longer in order to serve these people in various places, including Philippi. They're very dear to him. He proclaims that, of course, as the decision is not up to him, but he expects that the Lord will keep him longer because of what can still be accomplished through continuing ministry here on earth. Then he turns to calling them to respond to the Lord and develop their new life in Christ and show people the life is way beyond what they've ever experienced. He says, starting in verse 27, "Only live your lives as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ, so that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I hear concerning you that you stand fast in one spirit with one life."

He's writing to people who have a lot of insight into the concept of citizenship. Philippi was a Roman colony, which gave them the rare privilege, even though they were a long distance from Rome, they were citizens of Rome with all the privileges and responsibilities of someone who actually resided in Rome. They were very conscious of this concept.

What Paul is referring to is citizenship way beyond that, he's referring to citizens with respect to the good news of Christ. He says here, but he's even more explicit in chapter 3 verse 20 where he explicitly says that we are citizens of the kingdom of heaven and that's the point. It helps to have a little insight into what they understood at that time. It comes from the same root as city, which at first meant a fortified settlement. Then the fortification element drops away with it for the political development, and then a state as distinct from spatially defined territory. The city is the ruling center, first a town, then the wider area ruled from it. A citizen is one who shares in that community.

This term that Paul uses here means to be a citizen and particularly to live and act as such. The focus is conduct. The people in Philippi recognized that as citizens of Rome, they were charged with the responsibility of living as is appropriate and expected of citizens of Rome, not only those who live in the city of Rome, but those who have the privilege of living in a Roman colony.

> I'm looking at the NASB here, and it doesn't have the word "citizen" in that verse. It just says, "Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ," which is exactly what you're talking about. I've never read that as just in my life to do that, not necessarily in the context as a citizen of a city or anything. I never thought about it that way. They know they're Roman citizens, but I never even thought about citizenship.

It has that general sense. It started to be a citizen, but then to live or act as such. Especially speaking to the Philippians, it is using this term that they would understand as conducting yourself appropriately as a citizen because of the vocabulary in the Greek. What we're being called to is to live worthy of the gospel, particularly to display the fruit of accepting the gospel and receiving the new life and welcoming Jesus, developing that life by the Spirit in accordance with His word.

**Kittel's entry on Citizenship (polis)**

Let me go back a little more onto the end of their concept at that time. It's rather interesting, the generic links, the amount of generic truth there is in there relative to what is explicitly revealed in God's written word. I'm reading from an article in Theological Dictionary in the New Testament, which actually described everything word in the vocabulary of the New Testament except for a few very basic ones like prepositions and such articles. The articles were exhaustive in that they commented on every occurrence of that word. You could kind of sideways look just beyond me, you can see a bookshelf that's about three feet long. My set of Kittel filled that from end to end on the top shelf. It's quite a few volumes, heavy sledding full of fascinating information.

Let me read this article. First of all, the ideal content and distinctive phenomenon in antiquity, the polis, the city, draws its significance from the ideal content of the term. You may be familiar with the Greek philosophical ideal. They regarded everything as having an ideal reality and then a real. The ideal form is the conceptual model of the way it should be. Then there's the real, the how is that worked out in practice on Earth.

The establishment of the city leads to culture. This takes place through a free union endowed by Zeus, their concept of the supreme god, with righteousness and piety. Spiritual values develop and culture is achieved by freedom under the authority of laws that protect the common welfare. The freedom of the polis, the city and its community, stands opposed to barbarian tyranny. Individuals find true self-development in the common national life. Religious awe encircles state law. The order of the state has a religious sanction. Thus, it's a sacral organization. Its origin is with the supreme god, who is the protector of the state.

The tragedy, we get to the reality as opposed to the ideal. It sounds very current. The tragedy of Greek history is the reality does not match the ideal. Rational criticism, self-interest, party conflict, mob action, the cantonal confinement of the state—nothing that we can relate to today, of course—combined to frustrate the achievement of the ideal.

The Stoics introduce a wider vision, and Alexander tries to give it political shape in a world kingdom. Although for the Stoics, it's an ideal fellowship of the wise that does not need legal or social institutions. Indeed, the Stoics use the term polis for the cosmos itself, as a totality governed by a single divine law. As history leaves the Greek polis behind, the concept loses its vitality, falls victim to philosophical spiritualizing.

**Our higher purpose: citizens of the kingdom of heaven**

But clearly what Paul is doing here, which he does in many places inspired by the Holy Spirit, is he takes a term that is understood in the society and then fills it with truth. It's a term waiting to be used and waiting to be filled by truth. And of course, we know who the Supreme God is. And so this is a calling to consider. This is our higher purpose in the midst of everyday life.

We end up focusing often just on the horizontal. What do I need to do today? What are my concerns? Just horizontal life. But he's saying, live with a constant view of your higher purpose that we're here as citizens of heaven, of citizens of the good news of Jesus. We are here to represent Him, to be acting in accordance with His leading, the ways that He sets things up. And this is what we get to bring with Him to all of the dailiness of life, daily relationships, daily situations.

He's really calling first the Philippians, but the Holy Spirit through him knew it would go way beyond that to all of us. He's calling us to act and live our lives as citizens of heaven. And nowadays, a lot of people conceive citizenship more as the rights and privileges I have instead of my responsibilities as well. To act to care for those around me and act in a way that reflects the ideal of what should be there, even if others are not. And for us, the ideal is real with the Lord, but we need to be part of bringing that to a broken world.

It goes on in the Hebrew Bible, our Old Testament. Jerusalem is unique in Israel. God has set His name there. He's chosen it as the place of worship. Prayer is offered toward it because it is the city of God, the great king of the Lord. It's the holy city, symbolizes religious faith and national independence. Yet its people are wicked. Judgment falls on their violence and idolatry. God still loves it, however, and will finally establish it. His glory leaves it, but will return, and it will be called the faithful city.

**The faithful city: undergirded by God's grace**

Isn't it wonderful? With our wanderings, as the Lord gathers us in, we will be called faithful ones because of the faithfulness that we have lived out without regard to all the lack thereof. The wonderful thing is that really brings the culmination of grace because, as we've found it helpful, the law measures shortfall from perfection, which means it's a lose, lose, lose deal. There's no way you can win against the standard of absolute perfection.

Grace uses as the reference point absolute dead flat zero, and so Grace measures progress. Grace measures success, and we like to think of it in terms of how parents view an infant starting to develop, first starting to speak and then walking. All the excitement is on the success. In fact, the parents keep encouraging the child to rejoice in the success and disregard the many failures that are necessary en route. You know, a little kid takes first steps and falls down, and if the falling down concerns the child, the parents will just say, "Look, but you just took a step. Yes, you fell down, but you took a step. You're going to take another one."

That's the beauty of grace, that it will be called the faithful city. We will all receive a "well-done, good and faithful servant," though how well done and how much done will vary. But the Lord is not going to put us in a position of comparison with anyone else.

**The Holy City**

Back to Jerusalem as the holy city, national hopes focus on this restoration. The Old Testament city reaches beyond history to the final change God will affect. In later Judaism, prayer of the 18 benedictions sustains the hope of a restored Jerusalem as a cultic center. The darker the present situation, the loftier is the hope. That should be an encouragement to us at this point in history right now. With whatever development will come out of a week from today or yesterday, Jerusalem is already present in heaven and will be finally manifested. Its temple will be infinitely more glorious than that of the historical city. The wicked will be excluded. In the thinking of some, aliens will also be shut out. That was part of Israel's not understanding what it was to be chosen people. It's understandable that they kind of glossed over God's explanation for why he chose them, not because they were more numerous or more powerful or any such thing, but because they were the most stubborn stiff-necked people that he could possibly find. Therefore they were the perfect subject for him to work on because it would be like our daughters all concluded: If God can change daddy, he can change anybody. If God can reach the Jews, he can reach anybody.

It's a religious and moral concept rather than a political one. As time goes on, it refers mostly to a pious order of life in accordance with the law. This term used in Philippians 1:27 refers to conduct. It's literally referring to citizenship, but the emphasis is on the conduct that is called for by one who is in the position of being a citizen. Religion regulates the life of society and individual behavior within it. The total claim of divine law gives a different character to the society in which the Jews belong, and this determines the use of the term.

In the New Testament, it never means state. It's king, authorities. These are officials charged with responsibility, not an institution per se. As in the Old Testament, Jerusalem is the holy or beloved city. Reference may be either to the historical or the heavenly city. Heavenly Jerusalem, historical Jerusalem, will be destroyed so that hope centers on the heavenly and purified Jerusalem that will come to the New Earth with a consummation. Law-free Christians already belong to this city that is above. The patriarchs seek it as the only city that will endure. Lifting it only from afar, they live by faith as pilgrims and strangers on the earth. You recognize the references to Hebrews 11. God has built it for them in heaven. Christians look ahead to it, having no abiding city here. It exists in heaven as a true reality, the city of fellowship of believers of all ages, along with the angelic world.

In Revelation 21, this city is prepared as a bride. It is the perfected community of those who bear its name. It's purged of nationalistic features, open to believers of all nations. This truth is not just a replacement for the old one. It inherits the name, but all things are made new. We get to live now as citizens of the heavenly city. Bring that to earth.

**Unity: with one spirit, one soul**

And he'll get into some of the aspects of what does that entail. So that provides a setting and a connection to what they experienced on the natural level. We are to live worthy of the good news of Christ and be members of His body collectively, those who give embodiment to His life so that the good news is visibly evident and not just spoken about. So, worthy of the good news, and Paul focuses on their standing fast in one spirit with one life. We looked at Ephesians last year, and this links in subject matter to Ephesians 4:1, where Paul shifts from all of the background to understand that despite life, all of the outward differences, we all come to the Lord out of the same stuff, both the stuff that is obvious to me and not very evident to you and the stuff that's obvious to you and not very evident to me, which leads to natural division and judging one another. Paul points out we really share all that stuff together. We are joined together as one community and the one family of God.

The calling is, "I urge you therefore, to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you've been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, showing forbearance to one another in love, being diligent to preserve the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace." He's saying we have unity. He goes on and says, unity and all that will last, all that is essential, even if we are radically different in ethnic backgrounds, personality, the many things that tend to divide us. He is saying, in all that lasts, we have unity already. "One body, one spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who's over all and through all and in all." In all that lasts, in all that really matters, we have unity at the deepest level with every other believer, including those who are annoying, who can grate on us, who are very different from us.

One of the essential components of living as a citizen of heaven is to recognize and treat every other believer as also a citizen of heaven. With that honor and building together, we have one spirit, he says, stand fast in one spirit with one, literally one soul back to Philippians 1, a common personal interpersonal life. This is part of acting in a manner worthy of the good news of Christ. Many unbelievers use the excuse of looking at the church of not joining us because of all the divisions, and many don't understand denominational differences. We've explained that to many students who are new to the faith.

All of the bitter church rivalries, church splits, cliques within churches, gossip within churches, division, judgmentalism, and contention come naturally to human beings ever since Genesis 3, where we tend to judge by sight what's good and what's evil. We judge by our own concept of what leads to life and what seems to be destructive to life, but we come up with different equations on that, and then we're judgmental of those who don't agree with us. And that walks right into the church.

Being part of living in a manner worthy as citizens of heaven, citizens of the good news of Jesus, is to build together in that unity, to stand fast in it with other believers. That right there is a big challenge. As long as you believe in Jesus and have received Him, that's primary. Then there are so many secondary issues that we tend to make absolutes and that tend to divide us. We have had many challenges over the years with believers taking us on for various reasons, not absolutely teaching certain things about creation, not teaching certain absolute things about the way that the consummation of ages will come, pre-trib, post-trib, all of that. Our tendency is to divide.

It's true personally, just with the variety that the Lord loves. Then you add different spiritual gifts. It's so easy for people to say, "my gift is more foundational, better than yours". If you're really important, you would be whatever it is. And taking on more secondary issues as absolutes instead of saying (and of course, all of the political polarization now that has even destroyed churches) to be able to say, "we represent Jesus". That's the important thing. We need to stand together in that.

**Opportunity for unity as believers during this election**

The church has a huge opportunity a week from today. We've watched a shift. When I was a child and when I was old enough to have some awareness of political stuff and elections, the prevailing consciousness among Americans was we are one. While it was recognized that there are differences between the two primary political parties, at that time, it was also recognized that they're primarily the same. They have some different emphases. And itIt's not that those don't have any significance. But there was a spirit of being one nationally. We didn't just choose the political candidates that I was supporting, was hoping would win. But these are our elected leaders now, and we go together as a unified society. That was the basic sense.

In recent years, the two major parties have become more polarized, more extreme. There is still a huge amount of commonality, but the emphasis has been placed on the distinctions between the two, not merely as distinctions, but as differences and viewed as radical differences. As Erica noted, the political divide that has grown more and more intense in recent years has recently destroyed quite a number of churches where people have taken the stance that political views are more important than identity in Christ. What's important about you is not that you are a fellow believer, but that you disagree politically. Rather than being my brother or sister in Christ, you are seen as one of the enemy. It's really, really tragic.

We have a huge opportunity a week from today to stand up and proclaim witness as believers that we are one with those in the church who have supported the other candidate, whatever the issue or office. We are still one in Christ. Beyond that, although not having that most important basis of unity, of commonality, we are still one nation. The changes of administration are showing more and more flip-flop between directions that government takes, but we are still one. We are still devoted to pursuing the welfare and the quality of life, and people in this nation as still being extremely unique so far. And we get so focused on what's happening in our country that we lose sight of the fact that we have so much more, even with our disagreements and difference of opinion, than most of the world has. As the election results come out, we have an opportunity to thank the Lord for it. The calling to always giving thanks for all things that is stated later in Philippians and many other places in Scripture. Jesus is still Lord. He will be Lord on election day. He will be Lord the day after the election. And He will continue to be the Lord, and that's where our hope is.

**Verse 27: contending together for the faith of the Gospel**

I hope to hear concerning you that you are standing fast in one spirit, with one life, contending together for the faith of the good news. Not contending against each other, but contending together. In one spirit, with one faith. One common life. Contending together for the faith of the good news. We easily read over that and just say contending together for the good news, meaning the proclamation, which is important. But contending together for the faith of the good news. Faith is essentially trust. It is conviction about what is trustworthy and then trusting actively in that. It comes from a root that means to be persuaded.

Many people imagine that faith is a decision to believe that something is true, even though there's no evidence for it. Because if it were true, that would be a lot better than if it were not true. But that's not what faith is. When Jesus had people asking Him, He would say at times things like, "Come and see." He didn't just tell people, "you've got to believe this. This is in the Bible". But rather, "come and see". 

And "contending for the faith", contending together to encourage people to become convinced that the good news is truly good news and that it is the offer of true life and the means to attain it as a free gift from God, starting with forgiveness and then cleansing transformation progressively over time.

**Verse 28: in nothing frightened...!**

And I think Paul talked about an aspect of this because we tend to think of persuading others to enter the kingdom, but it's also about being persuaded to trust the Lord and grow. And Paul talked in Philippians 1:25 with his purpose of why to continue: "for your progress and joy of the faith" of trusting the Lord. We are contending together to encourage the trust that leads either into the kingdom or leads to growth in walking as citizens of the kingdom. He says, "In nothing frightened by the ones opposing, which is an indication of destruction for them, but of salvation for you, and that from God". And this also is part of being citizens. Not being frightened by opposition, which happens by putting our attention on the opposition rather than on the Lord and the good news of new life in Christ.

**Examples: Jesus on trial & Peter and John on trial**

We have amazing examples of this in the life of Jesus, acting as a citizen of heaven, the head of heaven. In John 19, when Jesus is handed over to Pilate, he had Jesus beaten, hoping that the Jews will relent. He knew it was because of jealousy that Jesus had been delivered up. And, they instead demand, "Crucify, crucify." The Jews answer him, "We have a law, and by that law, He ought to die because He made Himself out to be the Son of God." When Pilate heard this statement, he becomes more afraid. He entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave him no answer. Pilate said to him, you do not speak to me. "Do you not know that I have authority to release you and I have authority to crucify you?" Jesus said "you would have no authority over me unless it had been given you from above. For this reason, he who delivered me up to you has the greater sin." As a result of this, Pilate made efforts to release Him, but the Jews cried out saying,"If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself out to be a king opposes Caesar", and so he gives him to crucifixion.

But we don't need to be afraid. We serve the Lord, and we see that in Acts 4 with Peter and John when they healed a man who was lame from birth. The man is leaping with joy and thanksgiving to the Lord, and a huge crowd comes together and Peter proclaims Jesus, in whose name this man is healed. And they get thrown in prison by the religious authorities and then stand before them. The authorities would like to punish them but they're afraid of the crowd, so they order them not to speak ever again in the name of Jesus. They say in Acts 4:19, "Whether it's right in the sight of God to give heed to you rather than to God, you be the judge, for we cannot stop speaking what we have seen and heard." You guys can punish us if you want. You can order us not to keep speaking to people in Jesus' name, but God tells us to do it, so we can't obey your prohibition. You can punish us for obeying God. But we still have to obey God rather than you.

In both examples, this puts the responsibility on the authorities. In both examples, as they stand firm and proclaim the Lord and show him forth, people divide between those who will go to destruction or those who come to salvation. And we know that many of the Pharisees did come to faith. And I'm sure some of them who were listening to Peter and John were among those. And also, as Jesus stood before Pilate, he certainly gave Pilate a lot to think about, as well as others who were standing and listening to this interchange.

Even on the cross, one thief responded, and one did not, dividing. Jesus is not afraid of their revilings; one recognizes who He is and turns to faith, the other to destruction. We have that effect as we live as citizens of heaven, trusting the Lord not to be afraid, but live boldly on who we are and who we represent. Then others have the chance to see the Lord and respond in one side or the other. And we may not see it until we're home with the Lord.

Not being frightened by one's opposing. It's our confidence of having the new life by the Spirit and of having eternal life, not meaning merely afterlife, which it includes. Remember Jesus' definition, deep insight into what eternal life is: it's knowing God the Father and Jesus the Son sent by Him. It's intimately knowing the Father and the Son. And that's not a matter of when. That is, on our end, the knowledge, the insight, the familiarity, the depth and breadth and implications grow over time as we spend time interacting with our Heavenly Father and our Lord Jesus, and responding to the Spirit to call us to be transformed according to the instructions and descriptions in God's word such that opposition is not threatening. It can do a lot of damage, but it can't stop God.

**Example: welcoming your assassin into your home**

Knowing what the implications are going to be for me personally is really a matter of God's will, and resting in that has quite an impact on people who are opposing. We mentioned last night with students an incident. We had a man in his 90s who had a ministry among the longshoremen on the wharfs in San Francisco. Very rough group. He was living in a small room like ones that a lot of them lived in, especially the ones who were single, right in the area where they were living. He was in there in the midst of the community and telling people about the Lord. Some people responded and other people reacted.

One night there was a noise at the door. It was late at night. A man was weeping outside the door. He unlocked the door and opened it. Here was a man, very drunk, with a loaded gun. The reason he was sobbing out there was to come to kill this missionary to this community. He found the door locked and collapsed in tears at the foot of the door because he couldn't come in to kill the missionary. The missionary invited him in and said, "Come on in. If you've come to kill me and this is the time and the means by which God wants to take me out of here and to be with Him in heaven, I can't stop you. But if this is not God's timing, you can't do it." That demonstration of faith, of confidence in the Lord and who He is and what He does, that demonstration caused this man to realize that he didn't want to kill the missionaries. He wanted to have the life that the missionary had.

We knew a man in Romania who came in the same way. There was a very similar story. Erica remembered, as we were recounting it last night, and I just told you with the benefit of a number of details that she remembered that I hadn't. This man, I think I said, was in his 90s and he had reached the point in his natural decline that he could scarcely speak intelligibly unless he was talking about the Lord. Then it was absolutely crystal clear. It's amazing the difference.

**Psalm 37: Do not fret because of evildoers...**

One last passage that can be of encouragement to you when you're in situations like this is Psalm 37. "Do not fret because of evildoers." There are times where you'll be locked in with evildoers in work, in lab situations, in extended family, communities, churches even. "Do not fret because of them, because of evildoers. Be not envious toward wrongdoers, for they will wither quickly as the grass and fade as the green herb."

Instead of fretting and focusing on them and letting it consume you, focus instead on living as a citizen of heaven. "Trust in the Lord and do good." This is what I can always do no matter what others are doing around me. "Trust in the Lord and do good. Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart." The desires of your heart will be the Lord Himself and His ways and to grow in it. And He will do it even in the evil setting.

"Commit your way to the Lord. Trust also in Him and He will do it." He will be with you, strengthening you and using you mightily. "And He will bring forth your righteousness as the light." You will grow in Him through these situations that none of us want to sign up for. "And your judgment is the noonday. Rest in the Lord. Wait patiently for Him. Don't fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who carries out wicked schemes."

Cease from anger. We get angry. It's wrong. But He says, cease, let the anger go to Him; He's the judge. "Forsake wrath, don't fret, it leads only to evildoing." It will add to the problem. "For evildoers will be cut off." God is a God of justice and every single person will appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and all of the rationalizations and excuses will have dropped away, and we'll see what we did for what it was and the impact on others. Nobody gets off scot-free.

"Yet a little but those who wait for the Lord, they will inherit the land". "The humble will inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant prosperity." Nothing that others think they can take away from us, and they can take away a lot, but nothing essential. Our well-being for the long run is guaranteed by the Lord, and as we rest in Him, we grow in His character no matter what others are doing.

That's from Psalm 37. No one can take eternal life from us. They can take our physical life if the Lord lets them, but they can't take our life with Jesus, our life with the Father. They may interfere with it. They may draw our attention away from the Lord. But the fact is, we still have the relationship. It cuts down on how much we're benefiting from it at that point in time. This indication of destruction for them is salvation for you. What's the indicator? As I'm not frightened by opposition, that speaks very clearly. What am I being saved from? In the immediate context, I'm being saved from the natural fear of opposition. Over time, learning to be able to face stronger and stronger opposition with less and less of a sense of threat and more and more of a sense of actively trusting the Lord and allowing Him to develop His life further in us.

We won't describe any of them now, but we've had a number of situations where our lives were clearly in jeopardy, especially our honeymoon summer as we were transitioning from singles to starting into ministry together as full-time partners. The Lord did a lot to build us up. We spent immense amounts of time in the Word, but also there were several times when the Lord pulled the curtain back from what we normally don't see. There were several times where it was very clear that someone was intent on killing us. It didn't happen. We sure learned to trust the Lord a lot more. And so we were growing in our relationship with Him and being saved from the natural fears.

**Verse 29-30: to suffer on His behalf**

He continues on for, "For it has been given to you on behalf of Christ, not only to believe, but also to suffer on His behalf. Having the same struggle that you've seen in me and now hear in me." Not just trusting the Lord, but to suffer on His behalf. Why? Two things. One is, in terms of our own individual personal life, we are called to suffer the loss of things that we have considered valuable and important that really are not. That's the Romans 8 part of the third step of how to change. It's learning to let go of the pleasure, the security, the hope, whatever I was getting from something that I thought would give life that really won't, and transferring my hopes to the real thing instead.

The other thing is then interpersonally, which is a part that doesn't come until Romans 12. That is suffering the consequences of mistreatment by others, unbelievers, and fellow believers within the community of believers, not just interacting with unbelievers. Why do we go through that? Part of it's for the witness, and we talked about that, especially with the example of the missionary to the Holy Roman. But also, it's to learn the Lord's adequacy in the face of things that are threatening, things that are actually hurtful. The Lord does not guarantee to protect us from abuse. He protects us from a lot more than we know, but He doesn't protect us from all verbal abuse, physical abuse, etc. He teaches us to have our security and our hope in Him, not in those things, meaning the exemption from being the victims of such stuff.

He says, "Having the same struggle that you've seen in me and now hear in me." A lot of translations insert "to be" at the end there, and now here to be in me. But Paul didn't say that. He said, "You now hear in me." He's not talking about what you hear about through second-hand, third-hand reports. We hear it in him in what he is saying in this letter, what he has already said in this letter.

The struggle is between the hopes of life by getting out of this evil, wicked world with all the horrible things, dealings, and harm that people do to other people, and wanting to escape from that to move on to my heavenly continuation of the eternal life. Eternal does not mean then and there. It doesn't mean future. It includes future, but that's not the point. The point is, it's always. It always has been. It is now. It always will be. It's timeless. That's the implication of eternal.

**Suffering as training: producing growth & fruit**

As Paul says, that's very much better in terms of what I experience positively, what is pleasurable. But there is the opportunity for what I can participate in of the Lord's doing while I'm still here, which leads to strong hopes in what the Lord is doing in me and will do through me, by my continuing to be here and interacting with other people and representing Him to other people. It's hard to say, I want to opt out for more of this because of the fruit, the life from the Lord that I'm getting to participate in His giving to other people.

None of us like suffering. It's the part of our life with the Lord that we'd rather skip. I'd like to opt out of that part. Jesus did too. In Gethsemane, He was in agony, knowing that clearly, absolutely, in a way we don't, what was ahead and the horror of it. He basically said, if there's any way to opt out of this without scuttling Your program, I'm for it.

But Jesus did say, "In the world, you will have tribulation." It's a broken world. But have courage. "I have overcome the world." He does have the last word, and we will have such joy in that. He uses it for our growth, as Steve was saying. Romans 5:3-5 is one. James 1 is another where He uses the tribulation to hone and grow us. We become more full of His life in our thinking, words, and actions than before. We see Him as we trust Him to walk His way instead of the way we naturally would.

Hebrews 12:11, all training. It says discipline, but it's training. For sonship training for the moment seems not to be joyful but literally painful, yet to those who've been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness. We've learned to say when life gets tough, oh, it's growth time, it's training time, and I want to go for every bit of growth I can because I prefer not to repeat this. But I can learn it now or I can learn it later. But I would love the growth and I would love for others to see the Lord as I'm growing. I want to take advantage of the painful process now because I can either learn it now or I can learn it later, which means I'm going to go through more of this if I don't accept the benefit now.

By the way, the discipline or training, the term used there is the term that was very prominent in the Greek philosophy and especially the philosophy of education. This is about training up a child. The reason we get the discipline as a legitimate translation there is it is the training of a little child where there's only so much the child can learn through rational discussion at this point in life. The child has to learn that certain choices are harmful with some sort of negative experience that is not inherent in the thing itself.

We had a wonderful experience with that with our first dog. We were on campus waiting in line at an ATM on the deck of Tressider. And Kelly, of course, wanted to visit with everybody. She loved people and she loved students. And I didn't want her bothering people because not everybody appreciates having a big dog come charging up, wanting to interact. And so I was telling her to stay with us. I could see a bunch of these students looking and saying, "oh, that mean guy being so nasty to his dog". So I started talking to the dog like Jesus did on a number of occasions. He would talk to the Heavenly Father not because he needed to discuss with His Heavenly Father what He was discussing, but for the sake of the audience as He was speaking out loud.

I started speaking to Kelly and petting her, demonstrating. Saying, "Kelly, we want you to visit with students and you bless them so much, but you have to pay attention to us. You have to pay attention to our voice because there are times when if you don't pay attention to our voice, you could get very seriously hurt. Like if you were starting to go out in the street and Erica or I told you no and to come back and you didn't follow it, that would be the end of you, and we would be so grieved."

It was amazing. You could see these students just kind of melt. Oh, this guy really does love his dog. Anyway, we're right at the end of the time, but I want to give at least a few minutes getting into this tonight, which includes the gem that is really the center, the next verse, next couple of verses. It's the next one verse, which is packed with hope. Very quickly, and then we'll go into it more next week.

**Philippians 2:1, my inexhaustible resource**

It says, "Then if there is any encouragement, exhortation in Christ, if there is any consolation out of love, if there's any commonality of the Spirit, if there's any deep attachment and compassion, make my joy complete that you may have the same thing in mind, having the same love of one accord or harmoniously keeping mindful of the one thing, which is not focusing on concerns of self, selfish ambition, empty consent, but humbly regarding the concerns of others as more important."

In that series of if there is any, in our written text, we insert a gloss as indeed there is. The reason for that is the Greek had four ways of saying it. The difference between them was the likelihood that that is actually true as assessed by the speaker or the writer, and this form that's used throughout here is the one that means if, as indeed is true.

If there is, as indeed there is, any encouragement or exhortation in Christ, if there is, as indeed there is, any consolation, comfort out of love, if there is, as indeed there is, any commonality of the Spirit, if there is, as indeed there is, any deep attachment and compassion. As citizens of heaven, as ones who represent Him in the midst of difficult circumstances and challenging ones in the midst of life. This is our place to fill up. This is the well of inexhaustible life and water, living water.

Jesus talks about that when He was talking to the woman at the well in John 4, "Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life." He references this again in John 7:38, where He says, "If any man is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who trusts in Me, as the Scripture said, from his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water."

He's saying that this is your place to fill up with living water as you handle the challenges, the unfairness, the difficulties of life. This is where to go, that enables us not to burn out in the long run relationships, and not just to do things out of duty while hating it on the inside or just dying on the inside. This is the well of living water, the place to fill up.

He says there are four elements to it. The encouragement or exhortation in Christ is the Greek word paraklesis, from which we get our word parakaleo. It means to call alongside an advocate, a counselor. When we need wisdom and encouragement because we're overwhelmed, Jesus is the place to go. He and His word provide wisdom for situations that are bigger than I am, and He's the source of that.

The more under stress, under challenge, or overwhelmed you are, the more we come and draw back to spend time listening to the encouragement and wise counsel of Jesus in His word. This is the place to fill up. Any consolation or comfort out of love, and that's the Greek word paramouthion, and it means near speech. He's speaking tenderly to you. It's consolation. It's comfort. And more than that, the Greek root then becomes the German word for courage. As you need consolation because it's not in the circumstances. You need comfort. And you have it, in drawing close to the complete love of the Lord, which is far deeper than any of us begin to grasp. And then any koinonia, any fellowship of the Spirit: you're never alone. The Spirit is always there, one of the members of the Godhead, with deep attachment and compassion. The Lord loves us with everything within Him. He's already referenced that in Philippians 1 and compassion. He sees our need and moves into health rather than being repulsed.

This is the well to fill up with when you're overwhelmed, when you're dealing with long-term or short-term tough situations. It's easy to just stay fixated on it, locked on it, and He's saying to back off from it to fill up with the Lord so that it's the Lord you bring into those situations. The Lord's encouragement and wisdom that buoys you up and helps you to walk in those positions with high purpose.

We'll get into that much more next week, but I wanted to be sure to preview that as an encouragement of where to go even this week, because I know many of us are in very difficult situations that are overwhelming. So I will pray for us, and then we're glad to hang out and we'll go into much more of this next week.

> Oh Lord, we are so thankful that you are always here and we are with you. You are in us, and we know that you're not just calling us to serve an outward institution, but you are a living Lord who dwells within us by your Holy Spirit. Thank You for the riches of Your word, which gives us perspective way above and beyond where we live so that we bring You to hurting people, sometimes antagonistic people, and difficult people to be around, or even painful. And Lord, fill us up with You, with Your words, with Your ways, with Your comfort, with Your love. Thank You that you love us, each of us, more than we can possibly grasp. We ask to receive that love and grasp it more and more as we see it explained in Your word, to receive it and then to live it out and see you in the midst of challenging circumstances. Thank You, Lord God, in Your name, amen.
