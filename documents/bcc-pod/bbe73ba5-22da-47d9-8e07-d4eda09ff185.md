> Oh, Lord, thank You that we are people of hope. Thank You that there is so much that You promise to do and do in each of our lives. And we ask to really grasp the wonder of how You view us, how You view every other believer, no matter how immature or still hugely in process as all of us are. Thank You that You let us know what You're doing in our lives so that we can participate and so that we can join You in being part of it to bless one another. Lord we ask to hear so that we may join You in this amazing work that You do taking self-absorbed selfish people self-willed and making us new and growing us into the glorious beings who show You forth from the inside out. Lord may we both welcome that and walk in that process ourselves and also partner with You with wisdom to facilitate and encourage that process in one another rather than ending up being a stumbling block and even fighting You in what You're doing in the life of another. Lord, thank You for this very rich, very concentrated passage. Teach us all and equip us all. And Lord, give us joy in what You do and in joining with You. In Your name, Amen.

**Introduction**

Well, welcome. As you know from the announcement, we will be in Philippians 1:3-11. And as I was praying, this there is so much that we are told in this passage so much about how the Lord views each of us, how he views every believer that we will ever meet, no matter how rough and sharp-edged or no matter how rough and sharp-edged we can be at times. And how we can be a powerful participant in encouraging one another forward, even at times when our speaking directly is not welcome or not possible for whatever reason. So there is so much here, and let's begin by reading it together. Okay. People want to take turns who have the text that I sent you? And we'll start it at verse 1.

> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the ones set apart in Christ Jesus living in Philippi with the overseers and administrators, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
>
> I thank my God in every remembrance [or at every mention of you], always in my every prayer for you making entreaty with joy on the basis of your fellowship in the good news from the first day until now. I have become persuaded of this very thing, that the one beginning a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. As it is right for me to think this about all of you, to have you in my heart, you being my fellow sharers of grace in both my fetters and in the defense and confirmation of the good news. For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the deep attachment of Christ Jesus.
>
> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in true knowledge and all discernment, for you to approve the things that matter, that you may be proven true and not ones causing others to stumble, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that is through Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.

**Phil 1:3-5**

In these first verses, starting in verse 3, what really stands out to you? And is this a normal response to normal, messy people, especially when we live close together, long-term relationships, and what you do affects me? And how does Paul respond? How does Paul view these people? Well, I just... just your question, it makes me see that I thank my God in every remembrance of you. That's... I don't thank God in every remembrance of certain people in my life. I think if we were honest, it would be true of any person in our lives. And that every time you think of each person, do you give thanks and with joy? And do we pray whenever somebody comes to mind. This is talking about believers, and yes, we should pray for unbelievers when they come to mind too, but it's talking about our response to being aware at any particular moment of a fellow believer, of whatever degree of maturity or immaturity.

> "I think that's been my biggest lesson in the last few yearsâ€”dealing with what does come to mind when I think of certain people and then being convicted about it and being willing to let go of my feelings about it, whatever it is, and being willing to pray for them no matter what, whatever happens. That's a discipline that God's been working on with me for the last few months."
>
> Wonderful. That is wonderful.

People come to mind because of our being prompted by, really, ultimately by whom? Two ultimate sources of somebody coming to mind to us. Probably annoyance. Yeah. It's a nice name for it, yeah. I don't mean two persons who might come to mind. I mean two beings who are the ultimate prompter of what pops into our mind. But God and the devil? Yes. Yes, the Holy Spirit or the adversary, the advocate, the accuser.

This is why we are constantly thinking negative thoughts about other people. We see the accuser at work first in Genesis 3. It's his accusation of first of God that causes the first couple to be vulnerable to the temptation to disobey. By the way, have you noticed that FOMO, fear of missing out, is not a human construct? The formulation is human, and it's very recent. The phenomenon has been around from the very beginning.

**Healthy FOMO vs the accuser's FOMO**

Where do we first encounter FOMO, fear of missing out, in the Bible? Yeah. What's the first text that describes, expresses FOMO? As God not said? Yes. Well, actually, no, no, before that. Who is the first to refer to FOMO? Genesis 2, before the fall, God announces FOMO. From every tree of the garden you may eat freely, but from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat from it you shall die. God is pointing out that there is a FOMO that is important to have in mind at all times.

If I disregard God's instructions and warnings, I will miss out. And then it's the tempter who comes in and says, oh, no, no, no. You won't miss out if you do that. You'll miss out if you do heed God's warnings and instructions. But do this instead because you'll do an end around on God's defenses, and you'll come out the winner. So, yeah, it's the accuser at work.

We constantly have thoughts that are being prompted by the god of this world, small G, the accuser. It was God's enemy and ours also. Because we're aligned with God. And he's constantly using accusation to separate us from other people. Notice that right after they disobeyed, look at the accusation: the woman you gave me. He accuses, you know, it accuses the woman for his guilt and God because God gave her to him.

Our minds are constantly being filled with negative thoughts about other people, and there are various reasons why that is a natural thing in a fallen world. One of the things is, of course, finding fault with others is a way to feel relatively superior, but it doesn't result in actual superiority.

**Thanksgiving in every remembrance**

And so I thank my God in every remembrance of you. So there, as we said, we noted, there are negative thoughts that pop up, and we have negative remembrances of other people. The question is, what do we do with it? And how do we see it? Do we see it as the person? And looking at a fellow believer, do we look at the flesh? Do we look at the person in terms of the general fact or whatever specific manifestation of the sin that indwells every human body on earth? Or do we recognize what is true of this person as a new creature in Christ because of their relationship to the true God?

That's what Paul's saying. I choose every time a believer comes to my mind. I choose to look at who that person is because of their response to the gospel. Always in my... go ahead. Oh, it's really almost shocking how strong this is, that in my every remembrance, always in my every entreaty for you, making entreaty with joy. And ask in a minute, on what basis can he have joy? And he'll get into that in a minute.

Now, notice: what does he do with the awareness of sins, failures? He prays. He sees. If I see what the Holy Spirit's pointing out to me about somebody, then I see what God is doing in that person's life because of their welcoming it, trusting God by faith in practice. But if what comes to mind is an evidence of the flesh at work in the believer, that's an opportunity to pray for them. Because it's something that God wants to deal with, will deal with.

The thing I don't know is the timing. And it may be very high on my list of concerns for this person. And if I'm listening to the adversary, my concerns against this person. But I don't know what else is higher on God's priority list for this person that I'm not aware of. And so as I pray for this person about whatever it is, it may take quite a while for God's answer to that to be evident, partly because of the process it takes this person to get there, but also because God may be giving higher priority to working in more important things.

And they're often, most things are multifactor. So the person may be dealing with underlying issues that need to be dealt with before the outer is going to change. So this has actually been a real key for our 48 years of marriage. And we did not learn this at the beginning, I can tell you. We used to think, oh, if I see something, we need to talk about it and then we'll pray. And we had to know what to pray about. We had a lot more we had to pray about if we talked first to each other instead of to the Lord. We learned we had to pray in order to be able to talk about it redemptively.

But here the Lord has reminded me at times when I'm really, you know, bothered by something that Steve has said or done. And I know, you know, there's plenty that I've done too, but my focus is on what he's done or said. That the Lord has reminded me, I've not invited you to be a critic of my servant. I'm inviting you to pray instead. I'm inviting you to be my servant and pray for your fellow servant. And join with me in praying for him.

In long-term relationships, we get to know each other's vulnerabilities and sins as well as the strong points. And it's easy to focus on the things that are wrong. We're all analytical, and our focus tends to go to what's wrong. And I have, I mean, it hasn't been physical, but it's been all but a physical voice of the Lord saying, instead of criticizing, let's get redemptive here. Join me in praying. And it's joining the Lord.

If you remember in Romans 8, it says starting in Romans 8:26, that when we're weak, instead of being condemned, we're prayed for by the Holy Spirit. He says, with groanings too deep for words, and I know the Holy Spirit has groaned a lot over me, but He is praying according to the Father's heart. We're told later in verse 34 that when there's accusation against us, charges, and maybe based on something we really have said or done, who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who died, yes, rather, who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.

So when we're weak, instead of being condemned, we're prayed for by the Spirit and the Son. The Spirit from within, the Son from without. And it's not that they're having to beg a hard-hearted Heavenly Father. This is according to His will. They're all working for us to grow instead of condemning.

**Invitation: Prayer with Joy**

And so the invitation to me, to each of us, when we're aware of real areas of need that are in one another's livesâ€”things that normally make us the ultimate critic or annoyed or whatever word you want to use, angryâ€”it's a call to prayer on behalf of that one. And he says, every remembrance in treaty with joy. These are people he knows. He didn't stay very long in town the first time when the great earthquake happened, and he was released from prison, and the church began in Philippi, the first church in Europe. But he did return various times, and he knew these people, so he knows the good, the bad, and the ugly, and his response is to pray always with joy whenever he thinks about them.

So what in the text, I mean, why joy? On what basis? Just a reminder of what joy is, and this is how we have come to define joy. It's not a perfect formulation, but it's one we've found very helpful. Joy seems to be the emotion that accompanies the awareness that what I'm experiencing or expecting is life.

So why does he appeal to the Lord on their behalf with joy? By the way, before we get to that, this also, Paul is joining the Lord in how he views each of us. When he thinks of us, it's thanksgiving and prayer with joy. I liked your use of the word practice earlier. It's a practice. And I have a specific example that has put me on the path to even thinking this way.

**Sharing an Example**

> What I wanted to say was that I didn't start out that way. It was a conflict with my own daughter who stopped speaking to me. And after several months, no need to go into the whole thing, I was sitting in church one day, and the guest pastor, church here at PBCC, started talking about Shalom and what it really means. And God said to me, isn't this what you would want for your daughter, even if she never speaks to you again? And I, yes, of course, I would want that for my daughter.
>
> My point here is that from that day forward, I began to pray as she came to mind, just like you're saying, that she would have shalom. And it was in doing that, that I began to have my own peace about it and being willing to look at my own part in it, but I couldn't do it. I didn't feel it. I was still upset emotionally, but my mood and emotions and everything really began to change because I started praying that way. And then it became easy, and I was able to have peace about it and let it go.
>
> It took 10 years for God to complete whatever He was doing in her and whatever He was doing in me. And He reconciled us last March. Wow. Yeah. But my point was, it was in praying that way before I felt like it, that the Holy Spirit's prompting, that the change in me that was needed began to take place. So I tend to think this way more when people come to mind, and I feel a hurt or whatever, just step back and stop and pray that way.

**Fellow Sharers of New Life in Jesus**

That's a beautiful example. Great testimony of how this works. And all it takes is knowing that this person is a fellow sharer in the good news of new life available in Christ. And they're a sharer because they have at least in the most rudimentary way welcomed it, seen it as good news. And God looks at us, you know, we think of God the Father, and for a lot of people, that's a very difficult concept because of a very sad or tragic experience with fathers or father figures.

But when people think of the God of the Old Testament, but, you know, we've known a number of people who think they like the God of the New Testament but not the God of the Old Testament. Same God. Yeah, we've heard, "I believe in Jesus, but I don't believe in God,"... and we can understand that because judgment and condemnation make people run. But the thing is, God can't love if He doesn't want what is really life for us and if He's not opposed to what is not life and what destroys life.

The problem is we see Him as opposed to us rather than to what's destroying us. But the other side of the father, and we might say as long as I mention people's regard for father and its interference with their recognition of God's true nature, is God uses every experience with a father either to point the way in a shadowy but positive way towards the real father or to make us aware of what a true father must be in contrast because of learning what a father should not be.

And either way, positively or negatively, God invites us into the real thing. And the real thing with the father is what you see with an infant taking first steps. And you see both parents, mother and the father, just ecstatic with the first recognizable step. And of course, the baby gets so caught up in what's this, what's happening, completely forgets about walking and winds up doing a pratfall.

Thanks to the genius of the startle reflex, which is they throw their hands up, throw their arms up. What does that do? That pivots the body so the behind sticks out, and that's where you land, where there's a lot of padding prepared for that purpose. Why do they need to walk? It's the safest place to land. But the excitement is about a baby having taken a step and also, but it comes with first words.

**Our basis for joy (even in hard relationships)**

And so we have bases for real joy just knowing that someone has accepted the gospel. And again, the excitement with the birth of a baby, even though many of you heard me say before, you know, if you look at the characteristics, and we did this in class when Debbie was two weeks old, that, you know, what characterizes a human being? You know, walks upright on two feet, communicates with complex verbal language.

We were putting this stuff on the blackboard in a Stanford classroom with a counselor, of course, one night. And this was Debbie's first class at Stanford. She didn't get much out of it. She slept through class. God answered our prayers. She slept through it. Which means she was really catching on to how to go to class at Stanford very early. Anyway, but I reached over and picked up this two-week-old baby, snuggle pack and all. I said, then what's this? There was not a person in the room who had any question that she was a human being. But it did not show any of the things that we say characterizes a human being because we look at what characterizes a mature human being or at least rudimentally mature, you know, a toddler, a babbler and from there on up, so it doesn't matter how messed up a person still is. If this person has accepted the Lord into their life, we have reason for joy. With everything that we remember or notice about that person, it is either evidence of God at work developing a new life, or it is evidence of something that God will deal with. This is why the prayer, the entreaty, the petition, the request, "Oh, God," is so important.

**Sharing an example: re our expectations**

> It brings to mind the concept of expectations because with the several people in my life that I've had this need to learn to do this, they've been Christians, so I have an expectation. My daughter's a Christian. It's been since she was a girl. You know, it's like, but she's a Christian. How could she be doing this? Not speaking to me, you know? So overcoming that expectation that because they're a Christian, it should be different. I would think that Paul had already overcome that. He didn't expect anything of them. He was just willing to love them and pray for them and see them as who they really areâ€”in need of his prayer and in need of maturityâ€”without judging them or expecting them to be other than that, just because they already knew the Lord. Does that make sense? Does that go with this?

That makes a lot of sense. In fact, that's the dynamic that is behind the statistics we haven't seen recently, but we did see one set of statistics that actually said the divorce rate among Christians is higher than with unbelievers. Our explanation for that is higher expectations, and so easier disappointment and bitterness and resentment. Instead of realizing we're called to commitment for life, for your well-being and prayer and encouragement. Not to get into that subject, because I know there's a lot of pain in that subject. But the Lord is in it for the long run with us. His *chesed*, his covenant love, even if we're acting like babies and making a mess that he has to redeem. He's in it for the long run once we open our lives to him.

So what's the basis of the joy and the entreaty with joy and prayer at every remembrance? It's verse five and six. On the basis of your participation in the good news, a lot of times people think, well, you're just saying they're going out and evangelizing. Nope. This is much deeper than that. It's the word *koinonia*, the word we get fellowship from or participation, and it means to have in common. We have the Lord's life in common, and the essence of the term is commonality. What we have in common as believers, as people who have the Holy Spirit indwelling, who is in the process of developing and reproducing the life of Christ in us.

**Verses 6-8**

He says, having become persuaded, that is convinced of this very thing, that the one beginning a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus. That could be translated, will continue to perfect it because it's an ongoing thing. I know if it's begun, it will proceed towards the perfect ultimate goal. Of course, none of us lives long enough for God to make us perfectly Christ-like. But we can make a lot of progress.

**Sanctification: the Lord's initiative and our response**

He actually looks at two things here. In verse 6, he's talking about his confidence that comes from knowing the Lord and what he does without exception. Then he continues on, as it is right for me to think this about all of you. To have you in my heart, you being my fellow sharers of grace. Stop there for the moment. He says, I am convinced that that is what's happening in each of you. So the confidence is a combination of confidence in the Lord making it happen and in the one who is participating by welcoming that working.

Of course, we welcome that working progressively in different areas of our life and progress in each area. That word, fellow sharers of grace. So it's again, we're sharing in commonality with God's grace, his favor. That's actually a key. If you look at the beginning of Colossians, he says that they grew once they understood the grace of God and truth. As long as we think that our focus is on guilt about what we just did, it may have been two seconds ago or a week ago or 10 years ago, but our focus is where? It's on myself and on the past.

But as I really recognize that I and every other believer share in God's favor, that while we grow, we can really grow because then our focus is on him and on making progress instead of on myself and on my past, even if it was two seconds ago. "Oh Lord, I blew it again, the same sort of area. How can I even come to you?" And he's there saying, Romans 8:1, "No condemnation. I died for that. Let's just move forward. It's forgiven. You have my favor now. Now we get to grow." Put your focus there and grow with me.

The beautiful thing about verse six, that the Lord perfects once begun the good work, the Holy Spirit is there at the core. Each of us, as we looked at last week, we have the character of God planted at the core of our being. Now the rest of our life is growing so that we express who we now are, that beautiful character of Godâ€”love, the fruit of the Spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, being under the control of the Spirit. Galatians 5:22-23, we get to grow and practice into who we are at the core.

Remember, Jesus said, when one sinner turns to the Lord, there's rejoicing in heaven. That's the joy. Once begun, he will complete it in each of us. We will be glorious beings who show forth the Lord and his character wherever we are. We're in process, but we're getting there. We've seen it in people, believers who aren't even trying. It's the hard way to go. It really is.

**Examples: the more we respond the more quickly we can grow!**

I had a pastor friend who used to like to say, "I was dragged kicking and screaming into the kingdom of God." He became a very powerful pastor, counseling pastor. But years ago, we were teaching a series, a midweek series over in Santa Cruz Bible Church for the 40s and older, most of whom were human wrecks who had just been through bars and beds for their entire lives and really just broken people. We were asked to teach Ephesians to them. After Ephesians 1, what the Lord does and promises them to each one who's come to the Lord, we had an Irishman come up to us afterwards and say, "I'm afraid I'm losing my mind." We said, "Oh, really? What makes you think that?"

Well, I used to, and he basically said, lived my life in bars and beds. But this Christian dentist used to go in his fancy car and bump dirt roads and chuck holes all the way up in the mountains to find me and take care of my teeth. He led me to Jesus. And I've been growing ever since. I'm finding I don't enjoy doing the things I used to do. I don't enjoy hanging out with those people anymore. I think I'm losing my mind. He was seriously concerned about himself. And he's saying, "No". This is what we were just teaching. You are growing into who the Lord has created you, at the core, to be. His Spirit is there, and you're growing in spite of yourself. Now, you can make a lot faster progress, and it's easier.

He was so relievedâ€”so relieved and excitedâ€”and stayed for the rest of the series and grew a lot. Even with believers who have begun but aren't trying, the Lord will do it. We've seen it many times, but it's the hard way to go.

The much better thing is to grow and participate as fast as you can because there is more and more life and joy. But that's the basis of praying with joy for anyone where that life with the Lord has begun.

**Signs of new life in the Lord**

Last night, we spent a few minutes on the signs that true life has begun. How do you know? What have you seen if someone comes to the Lord? Just a few thingsâ€”what are some of the first indicators?

It varies from individual to individual. Thoughts?

How about in 1 Peter: "Like newborn babes?" The first thing that changed for me, that I remember being aware of, was what I was reading. I'm a big readerâ€”have been since I was a kid. It's not that what I was reading was bad, but I began to long for reading stuff with more substance. The old stuff wasn't satisfying, and so that's what my bookshelves are full of now.

> Like newborn babes, long for the pure milk of the word, that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.

Later on, then move on from milk to solid food.

What's milk? Solid food that has been ingested, digested, and prepared to feed a baby. You start feeding on the milk of the wordâ€”feeding on the word as others are teaching you, explaining, and telling you in simple terms what seems complex in scripture. Eventually, you move to reading the word.

Some people will suddenly become voracious readers of scripture. We saw this years agoâ€”many times, in many different ways.

**Example: hunger for the Word common in new believers**

During the gas crisis, decades ago in California, the stations were closed on Sundays. Well, it wasnâ€™t Sunday in this instance, but you could get gas only every other day. It was based on the first number of your license plateâ€”whether it was an odd or even number.

We were taking the dog for a walk before church, and there was an old converted bread truck on the street. A guy in denim from head to toe, 300 pounds of muscle with a ponytail, asked us if we knew where the nearest gas station was. We asked him, "Do you think you can go about two miles?" He wasnâ€™t sure, so we felt led by the Lord to invite him in to use our phoneâ€”this was well before cell phones.

We took the dog down to the end of the block, came back, and then invited him in to call gas stations and find out who was open. We noticed as he was phoning that he had cross earringsâ€”silver crosses. We asked him, after he was off the phone, "Does that mean anything to you, or is it just a decoration?"

Well, it turned out he was a brand-new believer who had been part of a motorcycle gang that made the Hells Angels look like angels. He had run Walla Walla State Prison in Washington from the inside, but then he came to the Lord. His "old lady," who was not old, also came to the Lord. She was almost certainly one of Charles Manson's witches, but she came to the Lord.

They were somehow released and driving south. They could not get enough of the Bibleâ€”they were just reading and reading. When he came back with the dog, he sat there reading, and it turned out he was reading 1 John. It was just like Philip with the Ethiopian eunuchâ€”"Explain it to me!" It was beautiful.

They saw in the word that Jesus wanted them to be married and not just sleep together. So, they hung a left to Reno to a wedding chapel and got married. Then, they realized that Jesus casts out demons. So, they practically killed themselves renting a rowboat and went out by themselves to get rid of the demons from the earth. They almost killed themselves in the process, but Jesus protected His fools.

Then, they ended up on our doorstep. We got to encourage them, and they showed up at various Easter brunches. We invited them to Easter brunch, which was coming up soon. For years, just before Easter, we'd get a call:

"This is Big Mike's wife. You having that Easter brunch again?" "Yep." "Can we come?" "Sure." "Can we bring somebody?" "Sure."

One time, they brought a guy they were preparing to go into prisonâ€”a new believer. They were praying for him on how to survive prison as a new believer.

How do you know that someone has come to the Lord? Well, you donâ€™t always know. You assume, if they say they have, that they have. You encourage them from there. Either they grow, or if they donâ€™t, they may realize, "I donâ€™t have what youâ€™re talking about," and come to the Lord. Weâ€™ve seen both happen.

Or, you start to see some manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit.

Our just-turned-four-year-old granddaughter asked Jesus into her heart this spring. After she did, she said, "I thought about that for a long time first," which is wonderful.

One of the first manifestations of her new life was the gift of helps. At that age, cooperation is usually the draggy, resistant thingâ€”you finally cave in, but only after making it clear you donâ€™t really want to. But all of a sudden, she really wanted to help. She was excited about the coming twins and wanted to be all set and ready to help Daddy and Mommyâ€”which sheâ€™s doing now.

Once begun, you know the Lord will complete it. Instead of being a critic, think about it this way: Parents, when a baby is starting to walk and falls down, donâ€™t say, "Oh, youâ€™ll never walk." They say, "They took a step. Theyâ€™ll do it again. Go for it!"

That's true with us, with other believers. Once begun, itâ€™s encouragement forward. "I know who you are. I know what the Lord is doing in your life. You will get there. Iâ€™m here to help. Iâ€™m praying for you. Iâ€™m here to encourage. Iâ€™ve fallen down plenty of times, but Iâ€™ve grown."

If our adult kids can tell us weâ€™ve grown, weâ€™ve grownâ€”each one of them concluded, "If God can change Daddy, He can change anybody."

**Verse 7**

Here, with the defense and confirmation of the good newsâ€”the confirmation is the demonstration in the lives of believers that itâ€™s real, that the promise of new life is real.

This is what Jesus was referring to in John 14:12: "Truly, I tell you, the person who believes in me will do the works that I do, and greater than these because I go to the Father". What? Well, the going to the Father, as he's explaining, is he will send the Holy Spirit. So the transformation will start happening from within the heart, from within the core of the person's being. And that demonstrates something of God's working in human beings that could not be demonstrated in Jesus. Jesus was sinless. What we saw in Jesus was staggeringly inspiring, but also discouraging because we saw what a perfect human life looked like. The discouraging thing is that it's so far from what I'm able to live naturally that it seems like it's impossible.

But when people look at us, people who knew us, known us over a span of time, see the Lord at work in our lives and see us starting to change in ways they never thought was possible, then they're seeing a confirmation of the good news. And it gives them hope. If you've grown, I can grow. Like our girls. "If God can change daddy, he can change anybody."

**Verse 8**

So he says, God is my witness, how I long for you all in the deep attachment of Christ Jesus. Compassion, tender mercy. It's interesting that term deep attachment the Greeks used it as the seat of passion. Passionate love and the Hebrews used it, it's literally Hebrew, it's literally viscera, which is the the internal abdominal organs and they had ideas that this one caused that emotion, that one caused that emotion and so forth.

For the Greeks, it was the passions. For the Jews, it was the compassion of God. And the reality here, if you were maybe from Appalachia, you might say, I love you with all my guts. I love you with everything within. And that's how the Lord views each of us. And that's how Paul is joining with the Lord in deep love for these people. And that's what we can do because the Lord loves us more than we can possibly grasp. And the more you grasp it, the more you grow.

**"He's rather fond of me"**

And I love the little anecdote of Henry Nowen, who's the priest who came to the Lord in the gutter as an alcoholic. And he said that his uncle would go and spend time with the Lord. Every morning he would go out and stand alone before the Lord. Erica had a place in the mountains that she liked to go and really it was my prayer. And so because she didn't see anything but beautiful natural scenery and so this man did like that but it's what he said when he came back in that was so sweet: "I had a wonderful time with my Lord, he's rather fond of me."

And that's true of all of us. He's rather fond of me. An understatement. Beautiful, beautiful Irish formulation. He loves me. And it's the way the Lord views each of us and every other believer you'll ever meet, no matter how still rough, rough cut and a lot of work to go. We get to join the Lord in that kind of love because we know what our God is doing in that person's life and who they are and who they will become.

**Verses 9-11**

And so where from here, the verses 9 to 11, and this I pray. That your love may abound yet more and more in true knowledge and all discernment. One note before going farther. What do we tend to pray about for one another? Lord, will you please fix this person? But it's very instructive and helpful to get to look into the heart and over the shoulder of Paul, of Jesus, Peter. What did they pray for? Because that's what I want to be praying for.

**Prayer: to grow in agape love**

And praying, what does Paul pray for? Of all the things he could have prayed for for the Philippians, he's been praying. He's praying that their love, their agape, sacrificial love may abound more and more. Sacrificial servant love. And why is this his number one item on his prayer list? What did Jesus say is the greatest commandment? To love God with everything you've got. And the second is to love your neighbor as yourself. Or if you want to upset, love as I have loved you, sacrificially.

Yeah, it's too bad we all translate that as past, and it's true. There's a historical element to his love, but it's an aorist. It's a timeless thing. It's that you love as I love you. As I have loved you, as I do love you, as I will keep loving you. Part of what we understand is that if we're praying that someone will grow in sacrificial love, everything else grows out of that. With the fruit of the spirit, it starts with love, but then goes on to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, etc.

And a lot of people have seen the love as really a summary that gets worked out in all those other specifics and if we're really growing in the Lord's sacrificial love everything else follows and it is the thing that alerts the world that there is a living God because it is not natural. This is not the "at church I can put up with you for an hour". This is the long-term real relationships where what you do affects me and vice versa. That growing in the Lord's type of love where I'm committed to your well-being no matter how you're acting at the moment and no matter how immature.

**Loving with true knowledge and all discernment**

It says in more and more and ever more true knowledge and all discernment. True knowledge. This is deep, intimate knowledge. Now, remember, the definition that Jesus gave us in the so-called high priestly prayer is prayer after the upper room discourse and just before going to Gethsemane to be arrested and crucified. That he said, this is eternal life. That you know that they know you, the only true God, as he's addressing the father and Jesus Christ and you've sent. This is deep, intimate knowledge.

It's the knowledge that is expressed on a limited earthly level in the marriage relationship where the two come to know each other the way no one else ever has or will know them. But this is first of all, true knowledge of God. This parallels the true knowledge and all discernment parallels the pair that occurs throughout the Hebrew Bible, wisdom, literature, Proverbs, especially, for example. Wisdom and understanding is the way most English translations will translate the terms from the Hebrew. And that's parallel because the wisdom is understanding the principles of God's character and what he calls us to.

And the understanding, which actually is the same as the Hebrew preposition between. And you often use paired, between this and between that. We say between this and that. Knowing the difference, being able to separate things out, and this is the principle as Jesus was talking about, knowing how to give good gifts to your children. You know, the child asks for an egg, you don't give them a scorpion. You know, in the things he used in that setting, they could be confused to a child, definitely not to an adult. But learning to distinguish between what is truly good and what is truly evil, to be able to recognize what things further wisdom in practice and what things corrupted, distorted, failed to achieve it.

And so here, the true knowledge now here is not centered in wisdom literature. It's centered in the person of God himself. And then the discernment is. And it goes on to prove the things that matter. The older translations translate to "distinguish between the things that differ," which is the principle of that. Things that actually are not the same, to be able to see that they're not the same and what it is about them that makes them not the same, and particularly in terms of what furthers life and what damages it.

And so, to approve the things that matter, the things that literally carry through, the things that will take you through the test to successâ€”to passing the test, to demonstrating, validating the fact that you do love, with God's love as demonstrated in Jesus and motivated and fulfilled by the Spirit in us.

Of course, love is used in a zillion ways nowadays, and it's used to justify all sorts of things that the Lord does not rejoice in. It's God's word that gives us the basis to know what looks loving but isn't, which is that it's actually destructive in the long run. And of course, our societyâ€”which, no society has ever been truly Christianâ€”our society did honor God's word as a basis of truth. And now that we've thrown that out, we have no objective basis of knowing where real life is, but we do as believers.

And so, he's urging us. It's really to know by God's word: is this something that He is delighted with, that He approves of, that I can join with, with a whole heart? Or is this something that looks great but is destructive for the long run? And it takes that discernment. You have to have an objective source to make these distinguishing judgment calls, and God's word is thatâ€”God's word helps us to know.

**Truthing in Love**

The church, sadly, has often polarized between truth and love. People become so concerned with the truth that it doesn't come across as loving at all. And people become so concerned with loving that they lose sight of what the truth is. In fact, in Ephesians, as you recall from our recent study in Ephesians together, in Ephesians 4, itâ€™s by "truthing in love" that we build one another up in Christ.

That's why we have a banner we've put across the front of the table at activities fairs. It reads, "Truth in Love for Life." When students had the banner made, it came back flippedâ€”it came back "Loving in Truth for Life." So we had it remade, but it was actually designed so that we could use it whether we were given a full table or a half table assignment. So the banner is half-width, table width. When we got a full table, we have them side by side: "Truth in Love for Life" and "Loving in Truth for Life."

Anyway, it's beautiful. But this is so that you may be proven trueâ€”that your faith, your claim to belong to Jesus, your claim to know God may be documented, validated by the proof that arrives through the testing. And that you not be ones who cause others to stumble.

**Examples: Truthing in Love**

An example of that: we had a student years ago who went through the Stanford STEP program training to be a high school teacher. After getting her undergraduate degree, she was teaching biology as a student teacher over in Oakland. She had prayed to be able to show the Lord to these students, many of whom came from rough lives, broken families. Of course, in a public school, she was not able to breathe a word about Jesus. She was praying and praying while she was engaged, and they had seen her with her fiancÃ© and saw how much joy they had together. Then it came time for the section on human sexuality, and she was teaching it. Somehow, in the midst of it, it came out that she and her fiancÃ© were not sleeping together. The students were shocked. They said, "We didn't know anyone did that anymore."

She was mobbed after school with students saying, "You guys clearly have so much love and so much life, more than we've ever seen, but you're not sleeping together? We need to know what this is." It just opened up the door for being able to talk about the Lord after school with students who were asking. It was her life, their lives, proving the reality of what was truly loving, an expression of God. It became a signpost of the living God that was attracting these students to something they'd never seen.

We had a parallel experience when we were engaged because Erica had had some back problems, and I was concerned that it would be something we'd need to be careful about when we got married and started to enjoy sexual intimacy. So, we were meeting with a doctor at the Student Health Center, and I asked if there were precautions we should take to make sure that this vulnerability with her back wouldnâ€™t be hurt. He looked at me like it was the weirdest question on the planet.

I know enough about human anatomy, physiology, and healthcare to know that it was a totally appropriate question. I couldnâ€™t figure out his reaction until a while later. We saw a friend, who was a believer and also a doctor at the health center. He came running up to us when he saw us and told us what had happened after that appointment. Apparently, after the appointment, the doctor was running around asking all the other doctors, "What do I tell them? I have daughters. What do I tell them so they will wait until they get married?"

But the alternative is approving things that God does not approve of. That's why He says not to be ones causing others to stumble. What causes people to stumble? By approving things that are not pleasing to God.

While there are people who go to the extreme of being so concerned about truth that they don't manifest love, the other end of the spectrum is being so concerned about loving that they forget about truth. Yes, this is the new commandment that you love one another as I love you. But, we must remember, how does Jesus love us? First of all, He keeps God's word totally. He was totally obedient in His life.

Some genuine believersâ€”and churches that are so obsessed with truth that they don't know how to loveâ€”not all are believers. Some are, some aren't. It's been said that just because you're in a church no more means that you are necessarily a believer than being in a garage makes you a car. I think that was Ray Stedman, one of his sayings, anyway. I've heard it in various places. I don't remember hearing Ray say it, but it sounds like something he would say. So, it's important with discernment that we are *truthing in love,* as Ephesians 4:16 says.

**Verse 11**

"Having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that is through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God." The fruit of righteousnessâ€”the moment a person comes to Jesus and receives the life of Christ, the Holy Spirit, that person is righteous at heart. Now, righteousness in practice takes time to develop.

**Defining Righteousness**

And what is righteousness? Because that's a term we all use, but do we know what it means? Anybody? To live righteously is to live a life that demonstrates God's character and nature and the way He works, ultimately the way He loves. It's the fulfillment of the purpose in our design and creation. "Let us make man, make human beings in our image," God speaking, "and let them rule." It is the fulfillment of being incarnations of God's image. We are not God, but an image is a representation that communicates to the observer the reality of something that they're not seeing. But they learn something about that by what they are seeing. And our lives are supposed to serve that function.

So righteousness is being aligned with the Lord in character. It's I'm filled with His character by the Holy Spirit. And now this is being filled with the fruit of righteousness. Well, why does he say that? It's because of what righteousness produces in us that attracts others. And it does not suddenly pop out there instantaneously. Fruit takes time to grow. You don't go out and see a barren tree in the spring, and next thing you know, you just turn around and in an instant, it's in full leaf and full flowers and fruit immediately. You can't just plant a fruit tree and reach out and pluck the fruit.

Our family prize among the fruit trees was an apple tree. It was truly an amazing tree. But it started out as this little sort of stick with a couple of twigs sticking out of it. And that poor tree died. People would arrive and find apples on it when it still hadn't even sprouted anything. And then various other fruit. It's a good thing the branches didn't break off. But fruit takes time to develop. And righteousness in practice doesn't just appear instantaneously like with the flash of a magic wand. It grows and develops over time, but it's what attracts people to ingest the seed, the seed of the word. And so it's our lives as we grow in the Lord's character and bring that to other people that they see the living God.

**The Fruit of Righteousness**

Being filled with the fruit of righteousness that is through Jesus Christ to the glory and praise of God. We show forth the Lord, and that leads people to praise Him. And I know several baggers up at Safeway who are employed because they're not capable mentally of handling some other types of jobs, but they love the Lord and radiate Him. And there's such a signpost in a high-tech society of the presence of the Lord with the way that they radiate His character, His love, His joy, all the fruit of the Spirit. And that's what we can do no matter what's going on around us. And we can always bring the Lord's presence to those places and pray that our lives will make people hungry and that they will see the living God transforming us, not because we're perfect, but because we're growing. And they see the living God.

So that's what Paul is praying for them, not "Lord, fix this mess and that person with that mess," but praying what will ultimately fix all those messes, which is the growth in the Lord's love based on truth and growing into it. So one of many prayers, but encourage you to go back through this and first receive it for yourself in this whole passage. Receive how loved you are by Him. Receive the joy that He has in you. Receive the fact with joy and thanksgiving that He is completing what He's begun in each of us. And it's the timetable is somewhat up to us, quite a bit up to us. But the fact of it happening is up to Him.

We love by seeing the reality of what God is doing in people. And with unbelievers, we love by seeing the potential that God has given them by their created nature. A potential that will not be realized unless they become sharers in the good news, but it is there. And God hates sin, but people think God hates sinners. No, no, He looks at every person, every sinner, and says, "I gave you a potential in creating you the way you are, and I'm eager to see that potential fulfilled." But it depends on you deciding to want it to happen. And then when it does happen, the excitement is what's happening that God's doing, not all the other stuff.

Anyway, so let's pray, and then we're glad to hang out for comments, questions, examples, anything like that.

> Lord, thank you for your joy in each of us, and that you intercede for us, especially when we're weak. But at all times, thank you that we have Jesus' high priestly prayer in John 17 for all of us, that we would be one with you and with one another, just as you are one with the Father. Thank you for that unity based on long-term committed love and a shared life. And Lord, may we join you in prayer with joy and thanksgiving for one another and in bringing the fruit of righteousness, the fruit of your beautiful character in our lives to believers and unbelievers alike. May our lives be a signpost of your presence and of your love. Thank you, Lord, for each one here. Please greatly encourage each one and give them joy in praying for others and showing you forth where you've planted them. Thank you, Lord, in your name. Amen.
