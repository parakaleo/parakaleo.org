> Oh, Lord, thank you for your goodness and presence with us always. Thank you that you are indeed with us at all times and you are good. And thank you that you lift us above and through the challenges of this life. Thank you for the two new little lives that have just been born into the world that you've been hand crafting for all these months and strengthen Phoebe and Justin to be your handpicked stewards in their lives. And all of us who get to join in through prayer, as well as those of us who get to join in directly at different times. Lord, we're so thankful to be yours. Thank you that we're in this crazy world with hope. And thank you for this letter of Philippians, the letter of real joy and deep peace in the midst of the challenges of life. And we ask that you will teach each of us. May we not just gather head knowledge and interesting information, but grow through each of our times together and be equipped to come alongside of others with your care, your love, and your wisdom. We're so thankful for each one you're with us from all over the world. And we ask you, Lord, to speak to each one of us where we are, to underline the truths that are especially for us, as well as for those that we'll have contact with. We're so thankful for each of these dear brothers and sisters. In your name, amen.

**Introduction**

Well, tonight, as you know, we are beginning the 50th year of this ministry, and we're beginning fall quarter in the letter of Philippians, the letter of real joy, of deep peace in the midst of inner and outer challenges, real life. And we know that this letter was written by Paul from prison, almost certainly in Rome, probably about 62 AD. This is mature Paul writing toward the end of his life and sharing with us how he has learned to walk with our Guide who's always with us to walk above what's going on with the Lord's wisdom and presence to serve in the things beneath, rather than getting so entangled that these things pull us down. Our prayer is that each of us will grow from each week, that we won't just listen for information. And maybe check off the box. Yeah, I agree with it or I don't. But really welcome the truth. Respond to the Lord with thanksgiving and welcome and present ourselves to walk in it as the paths of goodness for us and for those we impact. So that's our prayer today.

Tonight we get to look at the background. You may have been in Philippians many times, and there's so much to learn and grow into every time. We have seen new things and are growing in ways that are a leapfrog above where we were before. But it's easy to take the letter just in and of itself and forget the context that this was a real letter. It's not just a series of helpful articles for us to pick apart. It's a contiguous letter, and it's written from the context of real relationship. Often, we don't know that context. Who were the key players? How did the Lord connect them? Why was it even important? There is a lot more information in the Scriptures about the key players than we tend to think.

We tend to focus on the main players: Jesus, of course, Peter, and Paul. But there's actually quite a bit that we get to know about people that we would call secondary players—Timothy, Silas, people that Paul traveled with, suffered with, prayed with, and who were part of establishing this church.

Why was this church so important? This marks a major leap in the gospel going forward. We're actually starting with, we'll be in Acts tonight, getting the background because as we understand the people and the setting from how Paul connected with these people in Philippi, how he came to love them and they to love him. Understanding the story makes the letter so much richer and puts it in the context of real life like our lives.

Part of the beauty of scripture is that it does not present the main players as superheroes who never make a mistake, never have issues. We will get to see in the passages we're looking at that even the main leaders had issues just like we do and were growing just like we do, and that's very encouraging. The Lord completes what He's begun.

**The Early Church**

We actually start with Jesus' commission noted in Acts 1:8:

> "You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and even to the remotest parts of the earth."

As we know from Acts, the early church started out in Jerusalem. It was Jewish and Jews and proselytes, people who had converted to Christianity. They all had Jewish backgrounds or had become Jewish. They had this amazing taste of heaven—selling property, eating together, providing for one another, and the Lord's Supper together as part of their dinners.

But we know too that the Lord didn't leave them in this cozy situation long. He used persecution to fulfill His commission. You can get comfortable and forget what the Lord's commission is to us. After the stoning of Stephen, the church is scattered.

**The Dispersion of Believers and the Spread of the Gospel**

We have this noted in Acts 11:19-26:

> "So those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose in connection with Stephen made their way to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except to Jews alone."

So they started with the Jews, and the Lord said to them in Jerusalem, but then all Judea and Samaria and the remotest parts of the earth. And then there's a leap of the gospel that starts in verse 20:

> "But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch speaking to the Greeks also [and the Greeks may have been Gentiles], preaching the Lord Jesus. And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord. The news about them reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas off to Antioch. When he had come and witnessed the grace of God, he rejoiced and began to encourage them all with resolute heart to remain true to the Lord, for he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And considerable numbers were brought to the Lord."

**Antioch: The Sending Church**

This is a major leap of the gospel. Antioch actually becomes the sending church to all of the Gentile world. Antioch was the third largest Roman city in the Roman Empire, very significant, highly decorated by various Caesars and Herod the Great with marble columns and broad avenues and all of the Roman beauty. You can look it up. But it also was a very significant city. They had diplomatic ties all the way to India, all the way east from Antioch. Major trade routes went through Antioch.

There were Hellenized Jews—Jews who grew up throughout the Roman Empire, who had grown up in the Hellenized world, in the world that spoke Greek because of Alexander the Great, who swept through and established a lingua franca, which was not French, not English, but Greek. That provided the language for the gospel to spread.

**The Gospel to the Gentiles**

Roman commercial and military roads went throughout the empire and provided safety for travel and the ability to travel because they were patrolled by the Roman military. Sometimes they were a problem, as we know, but in general, they provided the *Pax Romana*, the setting of enough peace, enough security where the gospel was spread throughout the empire. It actually spread up the rivers and on these Roman roads that went everywhere to the major cities and communities.

Antioch was way north on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, just south of Asia Minor (modern Turkey). It was a very key point, as Erica said, with the trade routes going through it. It became the point of departure and return for each of Paul's three missionary journeys. This is where, for the first time, the gospel is open to Gentiles.

Just before, Peter has led Cornelius, the Roman centurion, and his friends and family to the Lord. But that was small. This is where the gospel blossomed into the Gentile world. The Holy Spirit was clearly given and received with gifts of the Holy Spirit that were unmistakable, that caught the church in Jerusalem off guard. They didn't recognize that this would happen as quickly as it did, and it really ended the "iron curtain" of the specifics of the law. For example, you must be circumcised before you can come to be in a relationship with the true God. Things like the dietary laws, the worship laws—all of a sudden, the gospel was open to the whole Gentile world. Circumcision was a major block, especially to Gentile men coming to the Lord for obvious reasons. Being circumcised as an adult male is no fun gig.

As you recall, with the incident with Dinah, when Jacob brings his family back into Canaan, where she is basically raped by the young prince Shechem, and the retaliation that Simeon and Levi brought was they got them to agree to be circumcised under the ruse that then we can accept you and intermarry when in fact it was to disable them because adult circumcision leads to basically inability to function for a couple of days. During that time, they went and slaughtered. So anyway, it's not something that men would readily choose. It became a real block to people becoming Jews as adults.

Now the gospel, the door to the gospel, is thrown wide open to the Gentiles. The Gentiles rejoiced and were so ready for it. The third part of why this was the Lord's perfect time for bringing Jesus and the gospel was that people in many places had really gotten over the Greek gods and the Roman gods, even though they still kowtowed to it and the Caesars declaring themselves gods. But they had in large part, many thinking people had really, they were done with that and hungry for something more. It was the perfect time, of course.

**Barnabas: The Son of Encouragement**

So we have Barnabas as a key player here. Barnabas, whose name means son of encouragement, probably not his birth name, but the name that he acquired because of his role in the early church. They sent Barnabas to Antioch. Then in Acts 11:25-26

> And he left for Tarsus to look for Saul [the guy everybody was terrified of because he had run around taking people captive and throwing them in prison because they were adherents to Jesus]; and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And for an entire year they met with the church and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.

**The term "Christian"**

That first being called Christians, that would have been a term that the Gentiles came up with. No Jew would because it links "Christian" coming from "Christ anointed", the Greek equivalent of "Messiah". They were fighting. The Jews would not call this sect that they considered heretical the anointed ones. So the Gentile world is waking up to the fact that many Gentiles are coming, are joining, becoming followers of the way of Jesus. That's where the term Christian comes from. It's quite something.

**Barnabas recruits Paul**

Again, this seems very flat that Barnabas went off and found Paul, but that was 125 miles both ways by foot. So each way. That was a large trip to make. It was Barnabas, if you remember, and we're whetting your appetite to go back because there's so much that actually is revealed about these other people other than Peter and Paul. It's so inspiring to get to know about them. Barnabas, the son of encouragement, he was the one who recognized when Paul had converted, had become a believer in Jesus and came to Jerusalem, nobody wanted, none of the Christians wanted to associate with him because they were afraid it was a ruse, that it would be like the secret police in Eastern Europe when we were teaching there, who would infiltrate Christian groups and pretend to be Christians to take down names and be able to haul people in.

By the way, you know how the believers could detect the undercover Securitate? They'd call on them to pray. They couldn't pray. They might spout some stuff, but it was very, very clear. It was not coming from the heart. So it's Barnabas who takes the time to seek out Paul, to listen to his story, to become convinced that he really had become a Christ follower. Then he introduced him to the leaders in Jerusalem and the church.

Paul, as many new believers in his zeal, turned into a real pain in the backside for the new church in Jerusalem. Things got very hot and hostile. The church packed Paul off home to Tarsus. Wonderful note at that point: "then the church enjoyed peace and multiplied greatly" after Paul left.

**Freedom from Law**

So we get to Acts 15 as we're gathering Paul's entourage that comes to Philippi. We have the problem with the Judaizers and the circumcision issue. Acts 15 starts:

> "The men came down from Judea, began teaching the brethren, unless you're circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."

Paul and Barnabas had great dissension and debate with them. They determined that Paul and Barnabas, along with certain others, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders concerning this issue. This is what came to be known as the Jerusalem Council. It really wasn't a church council; it was a consultation. But anyway, there was great debate, and Christians who had come out of a Pharisaical background were arguing that they did need to be circumcised and keep the law of Moses. However, they decided no, that wasn't right, with Peter giving testimony that they had received the Holy Spirit the same as Jewish believers. So, the Lord was ratifying that, saying that Jews and Gentiles are saved on the same basis of the grace in Jesus and faith in Jesus. And there's no point in burdening them with a burden we and our fathers have never been able to bear.

And so the response was, Paul and Barnabas set up to Jerusalem with Judas Barsabbas and Silas, leading men among the brethren. And Silas will continue to be a factor with Paul. So the apostles and elders sent a letter saying to those from the Gentiles,

> Greetings. Since we have heard that some of our number to whom we gave no instruction have disturbed you with *their* words, unsettling your souls, it seemed good to us, having become of one mind, to select men to send to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. “Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will also report the same things by word *of mouth*. “For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials: that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication

Why those things? Because those were all parts of pagan practice. So these are talking about these things as involved in pagan rituals. And it's important for the Christians not to be seen doing the things that the pagans around them are doing. It's confusing. So these things are not good in themselves, but it's very important that they keep the witness distinct. Of course, the sacrifice to idols, from blood, and this is from drinking blood to try to acquire the attributes of the slain animal, things strangled, and from fornication, and it's true, not fornication in general, but that was also part of pagan rituals, was ritual prostitution. So if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will fare well.

So they come down to Antioch and deliver the letter, and they're all rejoicing. And in verse 35,

> Judas and Silas, being prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brethren with a lengthy message. After they spent time there, they were sent away from the brethren in peace to those who had sent them out. Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and preaching, with many others also the word of the Lord.
>
> Acts 15:32-35

**Paul's Story**

So now we come to the beginning of Paul's second missionary journey. One quick note before we move into the missionary journeys: you can read more about Paul's story in the first two chapters of Galatians. That tells about the Lord himself, Jesus himself, teaching Paul the gospel. Paul was an expert of the Old Testament, among the top in his time. But Jesus himself, and you'll read this in Galatians, went away to the deserts of Arabia where Jesus himself taught him the gospel and how he's the fulfillment of all of scripture.

And later on, when Paul quietly goes up to the leadership in Jerusalem, it's Peter, James, and John—the pillars of the church there—who recognize that Paul and Barnabas have been entrusted with the same gospel, only to the Gentiles, while they, the Jerusalem apostles, are called to the Jews, and give them the right hand of fellowship. So Jesus himself taught Paul.

And then we know, when Paul returned to Damascus, he became the first "basket case" lowered over the wall because of threats to his life. And then, when he gets shipped off home, it's 14 years, or maybe a little less. But he must've felt like here he had come to the Lord, was on fire, and his ministry was over already. He had already caused so much trouble that it was just over. And there's only 14 years for him. Moses had to spend 40 years shepherding sheep after he'd been trained as an Egyptian general and prince, etc. And David had to spend years shepherding dumb sheep in the wilderness to be ready to shepherd the nation of Israel.

**Paul's Season of Humbling**

So, every single person that the Lord uses in a powerful way, and that can be all of us, goes through seasons of humbling where it's easy to feel like the rug has been pulled and what happened? Maybe I blew it in some ways, but this is a huge, just, it seems like it's over. And in fact, it's not. It's a training ground. It's learning to walk humbly with my God where my wisdom, my strength, all that I have is in his service and from him, not to point to me, but to point to him. And all of us go through times like that. In fact, in the Old Testament, the word for humble and affliction is the same word. And the Lord uses the affliction that comes on us from our own choices as well as from the choices of others to teach us to walk humbly with reliance on our God.

And then we can be useful in his kingdom. As long as we think we've got it together and we're full of ourselves and kind of really want to point to our own worth, we're not going to be very useful. We tend to make a mess as Paul did. And so he spends 14 years packed off home. And we know from Galatians, he was not just sitting there doing nothing and feeling sorry for himself. He was preaching the gospel because the news was going out throughout the whole region that he who once persecuted us is now preaching the Lord Jesus. So he was in training. And then, at the right time, as the gospel to the Gentiles exploded in Antioch, that's when Barnabas, the son of encouragement, goes and hunts him down and invites him to be a major player in the gospel going forth to the ends of the known world at that time.


Paul, who would spread the gospel more than any other person, turned the Roman Empire upside down, changed major social approaches, and many things changed as the true gospel spread. So in Acts 15:36, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brethren in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they are." The first journey saw Paul and Barnabas going around the southern perimeter of Cyprus, preaching the gospel, then inland and up the valleys into the mountains. They planned to go back.

The Lord did a very interesting thing here. Part of it, I think, was to send Paul more directly where the Lord wanted him to go than if they retraced all of that.

> Barnabas was desirous of taking John Mark with them, but Paul insisted on not taking him along as he had deserted them in Pamphylia and not gone with them to the work. There arose such a sharp disagreement that they separated from one another. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus.
>
> Acts 15:37-39

So they went back and visited the ones in Cyprus. But Paul and Silas then are free to just go directly into southern, southeastern Asia Minor, strengthening the churches where Paul and Barnabas had been, but going well beyond.

**John Mark**

One note, again, just to whet your appetite to start sleuthing out people in the scriptures: Who's John Mark? He was actually Barnabas' cousin and a young man. You can read in the Gospels, if you do your cross-referencing, about John Mark. John Mark's mother, named Mary, hosted the church in Jerusalem, and as the persecution began, Peter got hauled into prison. The angel appeared, knocked off his chains, and walked him straight out of prison. Peter goes to Mary's house, the mother of John Mark, where the church was gathered in hiding, praying for Peter. Peter is banging on the door, and the servant girl, Rhoda, is so amazed that he would be there that she doesn't open up. She goes in and leaves Peter out there, tells them Peter's at the door, and they are debating, "Oh no, it's just his ghost." Peter's still out there banging at the door. It's so human. It's not an idealized description at all. Finally, they open up, and Peter comes in, tells them about the Lord's deliverance, and then goes to a different place. But it's John Mark's mother who's hosting this big gathering of the Jerusalem church.

So John Mark, a young man, accompanied Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey and then abandoned them when things got hot. When it got scary, he left. That's why Paul was insisting, "We're not taking a quitter." Barnabas, the son of encouragement, could see the potential in the young man and wanted to bring him. The good news is, if you again trace his name, he grows, and Paul comes to value him, and so does Peter. So you can look that up yourself.

**Timothy's Background**

Let's continue to gather Paul's entourage that went to Philippi. He came to Derby and Lystra. This is going inland in southeastern Asia Minor. And then back, you know, going up the valleys, of course, and back high up into the mountains to these two towns. That's as far as they'd penetrated before. When they get to Lystra, Acts 16 mentions

> a certain disciple there named Timothy, son of a Jewish woman who's a believer; his father's a Greek, well-spoken of by the brethren who are in Lystra and Iconium, all wanted this man to go with him. He took him, circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts. They all knew his father was a Greek.
>
> Acts 16:1-3

Now we've got to say, wait a minute. We've just been settling that circumcision is not necessary. Not necessary to salvation. But it doesn't say you can't get circumcised.

So why this? It's to avoid a stumbling block because the Jews would have made an issue, and Paul didn't want that to be a possible interference to their mission. People asked last night, how would anyone know? And of course, here it's people who knew his father was a Greek and knew he would not have been circumcised. But there's a broader way. Roman baths were used by Jews and Greeks. And you didn't wear anything, so it would have been obvious.

**The Spirit's Leading into Asia Minor**

As they're strengthening the churches, they pass through the Phrygian-Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. That is Asia Minor, modern Turkey. Very interesting. "No, no, not here. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going." They were trying to go into Bithynia. These are provinces under the Roman rule, provinces to the east in Asia Minor. Wouldn't let them go east, wouldn't let them penetrate further where they'd been.

And passing by, they came down to Troas. They're going west and now back down to the coast.

**One note with this that's helpful:** Paul had been following the commission the Lord had given him. When he came, when Jesus stopped him on the Damascus Road, and Ananias is the disciple who came and prayed with him. The Lord told Ananias and obviously told Paul as well, this man is my servant and he will take the gospel to the Gentiles. And yes, to Jews as well, but Gentiles, kings, and Jews.

And Paul knew his calling that he was fervent to fulfill, was to reach all the places where the gospel had never been reached. So his wanting to go east into these regions was fully within his understanding of what the Lord had said. But now the Lord is modifying it. No, no, no. And it's very easy for us. We can get a strong sense of calling from the Lord. And it's easy then to just steamroller, to just say, okay, I've got the message and I'm just proceeding ahead. Instead of staying alert to the Spirit's modifying, okay, you're headed in this direction. But now we make a shift. And it still is within what you're called to overall. But a shift in the direction of where you will apply this.

**The analogy with navigation at sea is a very good one:** You're told to take a bearing. Fine. Set your bearing on that lighthouse. Okay, that does not mean that you're going to drive the ship on the rocks on which the lighthouse is sitting. It means that you go that way until you are given the next leg of the course, and then you change your bearing. In fact, the gospel did reach into those regions through others. So the Lord took care of it, but not through Paul.

Now, this was not an easy undertaking. We don't really think in terms of what this was really like because it's not familiar to us. There are no airplanes. There are no trains. There's basically no public transportation. And they do most of this on foot. And it's not just like going on a trail in a national park. Pardon me. I hope you can see a couple of these pictures. Take a look at the kind of terrain they were going through. Now, there's not actually a trail that we're looking at there, but this is the kind of stuff that they were in.

This is a 19th-century, I think it's 1836, drawing of that. Actually, the Romans had erected an actual physical gate at what's known as the Cilician Gates, which is a gap in very high mountains. It's a pass in the Tauros Mountains. Take a look there. And the road, the trail goes down the bottom of that thing and up the, I think, right through here. The Romans had widened it significantly. This was a major pass that all the main armies passed through. Alexander's army before the Romans and then the Romans.

Here's a remaining section of you can see what it looked like as the Romans improved it, but it's still a dirt trail and it's kind of drain rock all the way at that point. Paul went a thousand miles mostly on foot from Antioch to Philippi. That's the motivation of love. And it was not easy and it was not safe either. Roads, trails often look like this. This is a really well-developed Roman road. This is before the Roman cobblestones. This is using natural stone. That was the kind of the best that they would have been hiking on. And again, you can see the kind of territory they're going through. If you look here, you look down in the bottom of the picture here, right about here, you can see where the road goes through this beautiful, rugged terrain. All of it on foot and no very few public inns and they were not nice places anyway.

**Missionary Journies: A Labor of Love**

This is a little hard to see, but this is a crew in Turkey in World War I repairing this road by hand. And you can see that it's in terrible condition at that point, which is an improvement over what Paul went through. And by the way, look at all these beautiful pictures that are taken in the spring and summer. But remember, the winters in these mountains were not exactly thrilling. Paul described, and we've listed for you in 2 Corinthians 11, what he experienced on these missionary journeys.

> Five times I received from the Jews 39 lashes. Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. A night and a day I've spent in the deep. And that was before his trip to prison in Rome, because this was written before that. I've been on frequent journeys in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen, dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers among false brethren. In labor and hardship through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. Apart from such external things, there's the daily pressure upon me of concern for all the churches.

So that is incredible love. It is the Lord's love for every person to come to the Lord. And Paul shared that love and that dedication and zeal to go to the greatest personal cost as Jesus did to reach all who are willing.

**More Stories to Research: Nestorians**

And there are missionaries of the same ilk that continued for centuries and centuries. If you want inspiration, read some of the mission stories, but one that, because I love history, so one that, I don't know if you know the Nestorians, early believers, followed the Silk Road, very dangerous, all the way to China, to Genghis Khan's court. And though he did not come to the Lord, he welcomed them, gave them a site to build a church and to preach Jesus to his people. Then later, some very courageous Catholic monks made it to his court and he kicked them out because he was not about to be under the Pope. But the Lord Jesus had his witnesses there, courageous, courageous people. And so it shows the lengths of love to which the Lord goes and we as his people get to go through sometimes very difficult people.

**More Stories to Research: Father Junipero Serra**

A relatively recent example, Father Junipero Serra, whose heart was for the Native Americans. And he was a professor in Spain and tried and tried and tried to be sent as a missionary. And they kept rejecting and rejecting him. "You're too intelligent and you're needed here to be wasted." Until the Spanish king got afraid that they weren't going to grab off the territory. So then they did send him and he hiked on foot across Panama, contracted malaria and was bitten by a very venomous snake with the result that he walked with an extremely painful limp all the rest of his life. And the Lord actually used that to help him reach the Native Americans because they have such respect for someone who would endure such pain and the love that he was doing it in order to bring this message to them. It was wonderful. Unfortunately, you know, Serra has become another victim of cancel culture and not because of anything he did, but because of people who he definitely did not agree with, who became later involved with the missions. And then there was the Spanish military, which had a totally different agenda. And it was a constant pain to Serra. So anyway, the Lord continues to motivate people in a similar way.

**Luke's Joins the Mission**

> Acts 16:9-10: A vision appeared to Paul in the night. A certain man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us." Now, I'm going to ask anybody who has heard us comment on this next verse, please sit back and let others examine it. When he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

What do you notice in this verse? There's a very interesting fact that is revealed in this statement.

Well, it's a he and then a we. Yes. And now what do we make of that? Who's writing this? This is Luke. Uh-huh. So what does this tell us about who's with Paul? When? Well, Luke is with him. Luke is with him. But this is the first time there's been a first-person reference. And from this point on, it will be first-person plural, except when he's specifically referring to Paul or somebody else. And except at times for Paul strikes out by himself like he would he liked. While a ship was unloading, which took days, he'd like to hike overland and meet the ship at the next port. And at that point, Luke talks about he. And then back to we. So it's very interesting. So Luke is part of the entourage that comes with Paul to Philippi. Luke, the Greek doctor, very well educated because the level of Greek that the Gospel of Luke and Acts is written in is a very high level of Greek. Well, secular classical scholars have labeled Luke and Acts as the most beautiful document extant in the Greek language of the time.

Therefore, putting out to sea from Troas, who ran a straight course of Samothrace, the day following the Neapolis, from there to Philippi, leading city in the district of Macedonia, a colony that is a Roman colony, which means that it has been given special status because of appreciation of the Roman government for their support for the Roman Empire. And so it's designated a colony, meaning that the citizens of Philippi thereby become Roman citizens entitled to the privileges of Romans, which did not apply to others in the empire. It applied to certain places. Paul was from Tarsus and he was Roman. Tarsus was the colony of Tarsus. So Paul acquired Roman citizenship by birth, which the Lord used on various occasions, as we shall see.

**The Gospel Comes to Europe**

So again, here the gospel is making a major strategic leap. If you don’t understand geography or can’t remember it or history, the gospel is now making the leap to Europe. This is the beginning of ministry in Europe. So first we had the leap to Gentiles at Antioch. Now we have the leap to Europe through Paul and through his traveling companions.

They travel, they go to Neapolis. And if you look at ancient maps, they traveled the Via Ignatia, which was a major Roman road built by the military, which went all the way from Byzantium, which crossed the Pontus into Asia Minor, all the way to the Adriatic, where they could board a ship and go straight to Rome. So this was a major, major trade route. I think this one of the developed Roman road that we showed you, I think that is the Via Ignatia. And again, Paul and others used these major military and commercial routes as a way to carry the gospel. And so we know that he visited quite a few cities along the Via Ignatia.

He revisited Philippi later. This is the second missionary journey. He goes back and forth through Macedonia, including Philippi, on his third missionary journey. So he will establish a long-term love relationship with these people that is mutual. But here he’s bridging for the first time into Europe. And how do you start a church in a city?

**How do you start the first church in a city?**

Noting where this is, think of modern Greece now to the northeast, still on that same coast, was Macedonian region, and that’s where Philippi is. So, and how do you start a church where there’s, how do you start? And so this is where they start. So they’re staying in the city for some days. On the Sabbath, they went outside the gate to a riverside. Why did they go there? Paul usually went first to the synagogue. So there’s no synagogue. It takes 10 practicing Jewish men to form a synagogue.

So what do you do if there’s not a synagogue? Well, you go to where there would be a prayer meeting. Really? Why would there be a prayer meeting at the Riverside? Well, what happens at the Riverside? It’s the community laundry. And this is where the women gather to do their laundry. And they get to know each other. And the women who are devout and who pray, whether they know Jesus or whether they are simply responding to whatever revelation they have about God, they will gather together there on the Sabbath. They would not be gathering there to do laundry. They gather in the same place that they’re used to meeting for prayer.

So we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled. May I ask a question? What it says on the Sabbath day, does that imply that therefore they’re looking for the Jews or would the Sabbath have been observed by the Gentiles also? Good question. They’re looking for Jews. They’re looking for people where there’s already some sort of faith. Where there’s some knowledge of the Lord God and of the scriptures, which at that time is the Hebrew Bible, what Christians call the Old Testament. Good question. Good question.

**Lydia's Faith and Hospitality**

So a certain woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics. That means she’s dealing with very, very expensive goods. Purple dye was obtained from sea urchins. And you got very little of the stuff out of an individual urchin. So it was very costly to extract the purple dye. And so kings, et cetera, loved to have purple garments. They could afford them, or at least they figured their subjects could afford them for them to wear them. And she was a worshiper of God. She’s listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. So a worshiper of God, and this is the true God. But she evidently did not know about Jesus yet. She hadn’t heard the gospel. She’d responded to what she did know.

**Paul and Silas Unjustly Beaten and Imprisoned**

She and her household had been baptized. She urged us, saying, if you judge me faithfully to the Lord, come into my house and stay. And she prevailed upon us. Very nice lodgings. Now, of course, it doesn’t all just happen beautifully, smoothly, without any challenge. When we get to verse 16 of chapter 16 in Acts, it happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a certain slave girl, having a spirit of divination, met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling. Following after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, "These men are bondservants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation." These men are bondservants of the Most High God. Ah, on and on and on.

Now, what’s the big problem with this? Obviously, it’s annoying. But how can we connect this with anything that we see with Jesus? What did Jesus say when he cast demons out of somebody who is demonized? What did he tell the person? Tell the demon. What? Or tell the demon. Yeah, and he also told the demon to not say any more about him. He did not want to have the stamp of approval of people involved in demon worship. Confusing. They knew who he was. The same kind of issue as Paul having Timothy circumcised. Stumbling block. Confusing.

So, anyway, she continued doing this for many days. Wow. I’m amazed Paul put up with it for days, let alone many days. Paul was greatly annoyed. That’s an understatement. And turned and said to the spirit, it does not say said in the spirit. I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. Well, that’s the spirit speaking through him, but his manner of his reaction rather than response to the Lord came out at that very moment. Oh, wonderful. Now we can just get on with things, can’t we? Oh, yeah.

So, and one note here though, he was following the principle set by Jesus that we don’t want to be confused with demonic spirits even if they recognize that we are serving the true God because they know the true God. And I’ve had that happen where someone who was demonized came up and bowed down to me and I was... It was unfortunately a situation where I couldn’t stop, but it was, I knew that the demonic spirit knew that I was a servant of Jesus and that was why that reaction and I wish some I prayed for the woman but I wasn’t able at that point they’re just it was impossible for me to to do more but you don’t want the confusion of demonic witness of what who you are and who you stand for.

But there’s no indication that Paul turned to the Lord to find out what to do about this. He reacted. Yeah, he was annoyed. And I don’t think annoyance is one of the manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit. Understandable. Yeah. Okay, so when our masters saw their hope of profit was gone, so much for smooth sailing from this point on, they seized Paul and Silas, dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities, and when they brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, "These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews, and are proclaiming customs which is not lawful for us to accept or observe, being Romans."

Okay. And the crowd rose up together against them. The chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods. When they’d inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely. And he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. So here they are. They’re in the dungeon within the general prison. Their feet are fastened in the stocks. And that means captive buffet for the rats. This isn’t some nice, pristine setting. And it’s easy if you think about it. What would we feel like if we were in that position? Here, the Lord has clearly called you to this city. And you have sought to serve him. And then what happens? You get thrown in prison in the inner part. Where you’re in agony from being beaten. Yeah, you got a backache like you wouldn’t believe. And you’re blocked from reaching anybody in the city. And I don’t think they brought their cloaks back and wrapped them around to keep them warm. So what would it be easy to feel at that point and to be thinking? Where’s God? Yeah.

**Praying and Singing Hymns of Praise to God**

But what do Paul and Silas do? Well, before that, it’s easy. There are times in our lives when we’re in extreme pain, and I have experienced that, where even though I knew in my head that the Lord was there, it was one of those desolate times where I couldn’t feel his presence. And you get that ultimate cry of Jesus from the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" And of course, that was because he embodied all sin, all of the evil of humanity. But here, it would be easy to think, and we’ve had people on mission trips where they’ve gotten in a car accident. Are you guys still there? I’m here. Did you lose Steve and Erica? It seems they’re frozen. I don’t see their photo anymore. Yeah, they just dropped. Did you have internet issues with them last year? Not usually. Occasionally, but not frequently at all. Oh, they’re coming back. Okay. And they need to unmute. Okay. Sorry about that. We were notified. Internet connection instability. But we’re back. Just when you were going to talk about praying and singing hymns during tribulation, right?

Exactly. And remember, it’s Paul who will pen Romans 8, that what can separate us from the love of God? Neither life nor death, nor angels, nor principalities, nor any other creative thing can separate us from the love of God. Or even internet connection. And Paul lived that here. So about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God. And the prisoners were listening to that. So not blocked from spreading the gospel. The whole prison is listening. Wow, these guys are weird. These guys are amazing. We’re not singing, but they are. Suddenly, there came a great earthquake, so the foundations of the prison house were shaken. Immediately, all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were unfastened. That's quite an earthquake. The foundations shaken, sure, their foundations were not reinforced concrete. And now you can see the doors popping open because of the wrenching of the door jams and so forth. But everyone's chains were unfastened. That's something other than the earthquake.

**The Jailer Saved**

When the jailer had been roused out of sleep and had seen the prison doors open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners had escaped. Why was he going to commit suicide? If you were responsible to the Roman government for taking care of a prisoner and you lost your prisoner, you lost your life. And it probably wasn't the most enjoyable death either. So he figures suicide is better than what he figured was going to happen because the prisoners had escaped.

But Paul cried out with a loud voice saying, "Do yourself no harm. We're all here." That's certainly amazing. You're missing the jailer. What? What? Your chains are off. The doors are open. And nobody's left. Now, that's very interesting because you've got a bunch of people in the prison with Paul who are almost certainly not believers in Jesus. And they don't flee. I guess if something that amazing happened, you'd want to stick around. Find out what in the world is going on here. I want to find out how you got this power. Paul and Silas were good singers. Oh, yeah. They weren't going to leave in the middle of the concert. Not even in the intermission. Paul cried out loud voice saying they brought the house down. Yeah. Like Samson, the greatest advertiser of all time, took two columns and brought down the house.

He called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas. After he brought them out, he said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved, you and your household." Now, he may not have been asking the question that Paul answered, but he responded. Anyway, I think his initial thing may be, "How do I get out of this mess?" But there's much greater salvation. And he obviously gets that message. They spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house. He took them that hour of the night, washed their wounds. Immediately he was baptized, he and all his household. He brought them into his house, set food before them, rejoiced greatly, having believed in God with his whole household.

**Note: Handling the Unexpected**

Now then, the last section here is really interesting. Just make a quick note. If you've done missions or service in this area, you know that this sort of thing happens. Not necessarily the California Big Earthquake. I'm not asking for that. But we have been on many mission trips and friends who've done a lot know that the typical thing is you go in, you're set to serve, and then something totally unexpected happens. There's elections and all of public transportation is stopped. Or, you know, there are different things, but it happens pretty much every time. The first thing that you encounter usually is tension and dissension within the team. Notice that. Paul and Barnabas separate over that. People going on missions typically are not prepared. They're all thinking about the people they're going to bring the gospel to and teach the word to and encourage believers. And they don't think about the team and they don't go in prepared for there being challenges within the team. And that is really important for solidifying the team. Anyway.

And here, there are circumstantial things. And the next thing is all the circumstantial stuff. And Paul and Silas demonstrate the way to handle it. Lord, thank you for this. What do we do with this one? This is some place where you're going to show yourself in a way that we can't imagine at this point. But you will. You will use this. And we've seen that happen again and again. And so have many others. And then also, where do we go from here?

**Release and Protection**

When they came, the chief magistrates sent their policemen saying, "Release those men." The jailer reported these words to Paul. "The chief magistrates have sent to release you. Therefore, come out and go in peace." And Paul said to them, "No way. They've beaten us in public without trial. Men who are Romans. Oops, we forgot to check something. And have thrown us into prison. Do you know what happens to anybody who punishes Romans without a trial? Ooh, it's not good. They've thrown us into prison, and now they're sending us away secretly? No, indeed."

So we now know Silas is also a Roman citizen. So the Lord uses their citizenship as part of establishing his church in Roman territory. And the Lord will use everything in your background. It's easy to think that, oh, you know, a bunch of it's just miscellaneous. It doesn't matter. But we've been astounded over the years how the Lord will use everything in our background. And notice how the Lord's preparing for the future. Because Paul doesn't say, "Yeah, I got a jail, get out of jail free card. We're all set." He says, "Yeah, I do. You know, I got to get out of jail free card. But notice what else I've got. I've got the key to the city because anytime I come back, you better welcome me. Because I've got over you a major crime on the part of a Roman governmental administrator. And I'm not going to say anything about it unless I have to."

They've been beaten without a trial. But Paul isn't bringing that up. No, but he mentions it simply as saying to them, it may be in your best interest to treat us nicely from now on. So why does he do that? Why does he do what, Erica? Why does he not just go quietly and say, "Phew, we're out of there?" Why does he bring up this issue of citizenship and of being a Roman citizen? And then says, "You have to come yourselves." Well, this is it. Police reported these words to the chief magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. You better believe it. They came and appealed to them. And when they brought them out, they kept begging them to leave the city.

So what did they do? They went out of the prison, entered Lydia's house. They saw the brethren. They encouraged them. They took their time. They did some more teaching and strengthening the believers. And then they left. But they can come back anytime they want. And they're not going to encounter trouble from the government when they come back. Because they've got an ace up their sleeve now. So Paul uses his Roman citizenship at key times here for the protection of the new church. This is not a Jewish weird sect. This is something established by Roman citizens in a Roman colony. And you have already blown it, magistrates, so you need to treat us and those that we've been with with care because we know what you've done. And so he's using it not as a personal vendetta. He doesn't use his privilege as a Roman citizen for personal gain. He's using it to protect the new church. And he does, as I said, on the third missionary journey, he comes and goes several times, three times that we know of. So he will come again and he has an open door to come again. And that church has an open door to be established and does and is.

So, and we'll, of course, we see him use his Roman citizenship that gets him shipped off to Rome to present the gospel to Caesar himself. We know that he presented the gospel to Nero, one of the most despicable rulers that Rome ever had, and they had a lot of them. But the Lord gave Nero a chance. He would have heard Paul's testimony because Paul appealed to Caesar as a Roman citizen. And Nero, or at least his legal advisors, probably had to read all of Acts. One scholarly theory is that Luke wrote Acts in part, or with the immediate intent of it being a brief for the defense before Caesar. He took advantage of the time that Paul was being detained in... And he was there for a long time, and so... Luke had ready access to the key players in Jesus' life and the crucifixion, including he probably interviewed Mary, Jesus' mother, extensively. As we know in the Gospel of Luke, so many things that she stored up in her heart. Well, how do we know that? He interviewed her. Yeah. And he says, having investigated everything thoroughly, and obviously he did. Anyway.

**Conclusion**

So this is the setting. This is how the relationship with Philippi, the Philippian church was established, how the church was established. And it will add real richness as we read the letter because it takes it from just a flat page to real people and real people that we will meet when we're home with the Lord. That will be so cool to get to talk with them. And hopefully it inspires you too to do some more sleuthing. You can do it through cross-referencing with your computers. What do we know about Silas? What do we know about Timothy? There's actually quite a bit more. And just a hint, people think that it's very likely that Silvanus and Silas are the same person. So Silas is his Greek name that is used in Acts. Silvanus would be his Latin name that is used in the letters. And he's very active, and he's mentioned at the beginning of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. Paul, after, goes to Thessalonica, and he and Silas found the church there, and then Paul has to get out of town again because it gets too hot wherever he goes. As people have said, it is a riot or a revival or both. And so he leaves Silas and Timothy who ministered to that church and then catch up with him in Corinth. So they have been part of a very active part of this ministry. We know Silas was a prophet and a teacher of the word and Timothy was a teacher of the word. And so you can look up where does Silvanus show up and act as well as Silas and Timothy. And actually Silvanus also shows up at the end of 1 Peter 5. So he served with Peter as well as with Paul and probably was the amanuensis, the one who actually wrote Peter's letter of 1 Peter from dictation or from hearing Peter's teaching so often that he was able to take dictation and, as a teacher of the word, was adding some too, inspired by the Holy Spirit.

So, you know, we catch glimpses of these other people who are like us. Maybe people wouldn't think we're main players, but we can be powerfully used of the Lord.

**Prayer and Reflection**

So we're at eight o'clock. Let's pray. And then we're glad to hang out, answer any questions or requests or anything else.

> Lord, we are so thankful that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever. We're so thankful that you work through regular people who are still growing just like us. And we thank you that you promise to complete what you've begun. You, by the power of your spirit, work in us to become, in practice, the glorious beings that you've made us at the core by your spirit. We are temples of your own life, your Holy Spirit. And may we grow so that we bring your presence to one another and to every person in place where we are that we may be strongly used of you throughout our lives and may bear fruit and may that fruit remain as you say from John 15 that you've appointed us for that and gifted us for that as we rely on you and grow into more and more of the life you've given us by your Holy Spirit, your character, our personality. Thank you, Lord God, for each one. Would you please encourage us from looking over the shoulders of Paul and Silas and Barnabas and others and Timothy and Luke. May we serve you well in your name. Amen.
