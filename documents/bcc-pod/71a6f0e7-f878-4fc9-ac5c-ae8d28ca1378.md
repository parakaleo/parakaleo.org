> Let's start with prayer. Lord Jesus, we are so thankful that you are the God of technology as well as every other aspect of the universe. And thank you that you are right here. You hear us. You answer prayer. Thank you for patience to work things through. And we ask that the technology will work well throughout our time together. Lord, you know there's been so much spiritual warfare all day, in the last few days with the class on campus yesterday and all today and many other things. So Lord, we ask for your protection and Lord, please use this time together for tremendous encouragement for every one of us. Thank you that though some of what we're looking at may be very familiar, we ask that we will grow from it, that we will not just listen for information but listen to you in order to receive and grow in the truth, the abundant promises of who you are and who you've made us and who you are making us and how you are at work among us and how you view us when we're still very much in the process of growing. Lord, please speak to every one of us and we thank you for each one here. You know them intimately and knowing everything about us, you love us. Lord, be at work among us and equip us too to bring your words of life and grace and truth to others as we have opportunity. Thank you, Lord.

> Lord, as Erica was praying, you know us. You created us. You designed us. You created us. You know who and what you have created us to be. And you know your purposes for that and your intent and the potential that you have created into each one of us. First of all, as creatures created in your image, and secondly, as new creatures in Christ, set us free from seeing ourselves through the eyes of the world, through the eyes of the flesh, through eyes that just see performance and don't comprehend hope. Lord, thank you that you look at us through your awareness of your hope for us, whether we are aware of it or not. But Lord, make us aware of it.

> Lord, we're learning, we're growing, and you know, as Paul says in verse 6 of Philippians 1, that he is convinced of this very thing, that the one beginning a good work in us, perfect it until the day of Christ's coming. Let us see ourselves and each other in that light as you see us. Thank you for this time together. Thank you for getting us through over the computer hurdles. Lord, thank you. We do appreciate everybody's prayers, as Erica said. The warfare starting this school year has been humongous, every which way we've turned. But Lord, you are the victor. And we keep our eyes on you and the confidence that you are leading us in your triumph in Christ Jesus. Amen. Guide us in this time. Amen.

### Introduction to Philippians

**Recap from Acts**

Tonight we get to start into Philippians itself. If you recall last week, we were in Acts looking at the background. How did the relationship between Paul and the Philippians start? And remember the significance of the Lord opening the door to Philippi: this is the leap of the gospel into Europe. First, there was the leap of the gospel to the Gentiles, especially with Antioch becoming the sending center to the Gentile world of the gospel. And then through Paul and Silas, we saw them travel a thousand miles, mostly on foot, through very rough territory, tremendous love, and the Lord calling them to bridge across to Europe with the gospel. And of course, it started with what looked like disaster, as things usually do, getting beaten and thrown in prison, singing praises to God, and the Lord brings the house down with the huge earthquake that begins the church in Europe. And the church that forms out of that, starting with the chief jailer and his family, and Lydia, the wealthy merchant lady who housed the first church in Philadelphia, probably in her quite large house.

Now we get to start into the letter itself. And as we know, Paul was writing from Rome in prison again, and probably about 62 AD. And he's right at the end of his life. And he will get to present the gospel to Nero, one of the most despicable people who have ever lived. But the Lord loves and sought to reach him and had the Apostle Paul present the gospel to him before he was beheaded. So the Lord is always accomplishing so much, even through what looks like disaster.

**How to approach this study**

And now we get to start the letter and our encouragement to you, because probably all of us are quite familiar with Philippians. It's a favorite of Christians. Some of you, maybe all of you have taught it before. We've taught it many times. But our encouragement is not just to take in information or to check off, yep, I agree with that, I agree with that, I agree with that, which doesn't change us. But instead, to ask the Lord to be alert to his voice underlining familiar scripture and respond to him with each point. Take time as we're in the study. Take time afterwards to go back and pray and thank the Lord for each aspect and welcome it in your life, welcome what we're looking at. Let the truth transform each one of us. That's our prayer. And as it does, as we put the weight of our life into what he says, even in the first verses, we are equipped to help so many more and to speak words of hope.

And a lot of times, believers, though we should be the people of hope above all, we have tremendous everything in the world because of the Lord out of the world to hope in. But many believers are not people of hope. And so hear what is true for you and hear it for others as well. And respond. And that's our prayer for every one of us and for the students as well. And we had a wonderful time last night with, again, this great group of grad students and one upperclassman, but mostly PhD students from all over the world. So let's begin.

**Philippians 1:1-2**

Paul starts the letter with declaring how he views himself and his ministry companion, Timothy, and those they're writing to. And most importantly, the Lord. And this is vitally important to us in seeking to minister to others, whether formally or informally, whether it's a structured ministry effort, or whether it is just what the Lord does in the moment, in the circumstances, in that particular opportunity. Notice that Paul always... Should we read the first verses? Sure.

> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the ones set apart by God in Christ Jesus...
> living in Philippi with the overseers and deacons, grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

We now have a listing of all the participants in this relationship. The first thing we note is that Paul, in his letters, always addresses it as being from himself and from his ministry partner at the time. Now, Paul is the actual one who voices the text of the letter. But the relationship is not just Paul individually; it's always Paul and whoever is partnering with him, teaming with him, whoever he is discipling for ministry and taking along with him if he's traveling. And that is very important.

Paul doesn’t claim his status, which is absolutely unique in the New Testament church, but he doesn’t claim anything special for himself. He describes himself and his ministry partner as servants of Christ Jesus. He could tout his position as an apostle, moreover, the apostle to the Gentiles, but he doesn’t. Letters at this time customarily started just as this one does, with identifying the sender and the recipient or recipients. And so he’s following the standard format. But I think it’s quite different from what was typical. I know because I’ve seen the text of plenty of letters from that time.

### Verse 1

**Paul and Timothy: Servants of Christ Jesus**

Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus. And as Steve said, Paul is not the lone ranger Christian who is out there doing it all himself. He’s always working with a team and bringing along those who are younger, teaching them, but not holding them on the side, having them join in with teaching responsibility, with prayer, with ministry. Even though younger ones could make it a little messy. Of course, we all make things messy, all did. But he’s not afraid to welcome ones who are still coming along, recognizing he is too.

The fact that he and they view themselves as servants of Christ Jesus is actually very important. It’s easy to be fragmented or compartmentalized in who we think we are. In my work setting, I’m a whatever, working with AI or medicine or whatever it is. In my home setting, I’m something else. But Paul and those working with him had one view of who they were. It was unified. And in any, every setting, wherever they were, they had the focus. We are here to serve the Lord. We are partnering with him. We’re serving him. That is who we are. That is our purpose. Whether we’re home, whether we’re out on the fields, whether at the home church, wherever they are.

It was that single focus, in part, that helped them to do so much. When they woke up, they knew who they were. They were devoted to that purpose. And that actually is a wonderful encouragement for each of us to wake up and present ourselves to the Lord to serve with him today in whatever setting I’m going to be in or whoever I will be in touch with. And that helps us to be alert to how the Lord wants to use us. And as we know, Paul and his companions turned the Roman Empire upside down. This gospel spread so fast through them, and every church he established spread up the rivers along the trade routes. He was planting seeds that then grew and flourished in many places. He was single-focused like that, and it has helped me even as we’re studying this to present myself before getting out of bed. I’m here to be your servant, to bless Steve, to bless others, to be alert to you as I’m on the dog walk.

I had someone ask for prayer today on the dog walk. It’s wherever we are, there are so many opportunities, at least to pray. So know who you are. Present yourself to the Lord to that and be alert to even if it’s just for prayer. If you’re fairly isolated, there is still so much you can do. And that’s the way to connect with people, not just believers. But unbelievers recoil from believers who give them the impression that they’re trying to do something to them, whether that’s the intent of the believers or not. They’re very wary. You know, don’t lay your trip on me. But they’re open, although rightfully wary, because this is a fallen world full of ungodly motives, as well as some godly motives.

If they can see that someone wants to serve them, and we see that in Jesus’ ministry, the first thing he does is ministry to the multitude, to the crowd, where he does a combination of meeting needs that they know they have, feeding, healing, restoring relationships. Start where people know their need or where they will welcome the benefit. And that also gave him an opportunity to teach, to let people hear. And what he taught was intended for those who have ears to hear, which was the minority in the crowd, and to let them get to know him and let those who are able to see it and welcome it recognize that he came to serve.

By the way, Jesus himself said, "I, as the Son of Man, have not come to be served, but to serve and give my life a ransom for many." Having the attitude of a servant opens doors, opens windows, and within the church too. It’s not just with unbelievers, but within the church, people are wary of people with agendas. And a lot of times, people think about this statement as applying to someone in full-time ministry. You’re a missionary, you’re a pastor, but it is for all believers and whatever your profession is and your gifting and wherever you are.

**Example: Jimmy Carter**

I’ll give two examples for those who might have been alert to it on the news yesterday, all of the bad news. It was Jimmy Carter’s 100th birthday yesterday. And anyway, maybe it was the day before, but anyway. And he, of course, had one term as president. And no matter what you think about his politics or policies, he was a believer. And we actually heard him in person years ago at a prayer breakfast here in the Bay Area. And we do know that after his term as president, he and his wife spent 40 years bringing the Lord’s blessing globally. They did massive work with the time and the strength that they had left that benefited so many people, Habitat for Humanity, eradicating worms in some population somewhere else that I’ve forgotten. But they were constantly, they viewed themselves as servants of Christ and used their gifting and their opportunities to do as much as they could.

We actually, after the prayer breakfast, he invited anybody who wanted to and could keep up to go running with him. So we went running with Jimmy Carter. And there were a bunch of other people, but there actually, there was a little group of five runners who were out leading the pack, and then a lot of people following along. And three of those five were engaged in conversation the whole time. The two were not engaged in the conversation were the Secret Service Presidential Protection Division agents who had to be right next to him at all times, including to be sure we didn’t do anything to him. So we and Jimmy Carter, two on one, spent a significant amount of time talking as we were running together.

What he did was he told us some of the special opportunities he had as a believer as a head of state. And two examples of that, Anwar Sadat of Egypt was one of his best friends. And they were in a limousine going someplace. And Anwar Sadat said, "I understand how the Muslims and the Jews trace history themselves back to Abraham. But I don’t understand how can Christians do that?" And so that gave Jimmy Carter a chance to answer that, that we too are the children of Abraham through faith. And so he got, Anwar Sadat got to hear the gospel from his good friend, Jimmy Carter. And two months later, he was assassinated. So the Lord gave him the opportunity. We don’t know how he responded, but the Lord gave him the opportunity to hear the gospel and to respond from a friend who loved him.

He ended up having the same opportunity with the president, the then president of South Korea, I think it was at that point, President Kim. It might have been Park. I’m not sure which, but anyway. One of those two, you got 90% of all Koreans covered. Anyway, they again were in a limousine going somewhere. He called it. He said the taxi in his humble way. Yeah. Not a chance. But again, the president of South Korea asked him about faith in Christ, and he got to explain the gospel. And again, two months later, that man was assassinated. Sounds dangerous to talk with Jimmy Carter, but you guys are safe. You already know the guy. He had these amazing opportunities as head of state. And he also said that the queen and princesses of the Netherlands were believers, and they would go door to door evangelizing in their own country.

But as president of the United States and in the decades after his active term, he saw himself and he and his wife saw themselves as servants of Christ. That was their identity. That was their high purpose. Many people have no purpose now. They’re just living. They’re just doing their career, just trying to succeed in some form or another. But we have high purpose to join with Jesus as he is at work in this deeply broken world.

**My identity: sinner or saint?**

Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, who all the ones set apart, writing to every believer, specifically writing to those who reside in Philippi. Those set apart, that’s "sanctified", to use the technical term. It’s typically translated in its general occurrences, "holy", "holy ones". And in English Bible translation terminology, it’s customarily rendered "saints". The problem with rendering it saints, which is perfectly legitimate, is that we readily misunderstand because we confuse it with designated saints in the institutional church. And there’s real value to church institutions recognizing exemplary believers and setting them up as models for others. There are other aspects that we don’t quite agree with of the tradition, but that’s not important. And Paul is not talking about those people. And part of the misunderstanding is people get the idea that if they haven’t been canonized by the institutional church, they’re not saints. Actually, who are you? If you are a new creature in Christ, if you believe in Jesus—not just that he existed, but that you have trusted in what he came to offer, new life from God the Father and by the Spirit—and you have accepted the invitation and have welcomed Jesus to come into your life through the agency of the Holy Spirit and reproduce the life of the true God in you, then you are a saint.

There's a lot of confusion in the church. Many churches, in membership ceremonies of whatever sort, require new members to declare some variation on, "I am a sinner." They may say, "I am a sinner saved by grace." But that's not true. You were a sinner. You're no longer a sinner. That's no longer who you are. You do still sin. I and you, as genuine believers, are saints who still sin. But sin is not our identity. Our identity is that we are holy ones. We are righteous in essence at heart, and we are in the process of learning to live righteously in practice.

But the question is, who are you? And that is really, really important to our hope. We don't understand who God has already made us as believers in Jesus. We will get bogged down into all of the, "Oh, well, yeah, but, you know, I just can't," and so forth. We don't have hope unless we recognize it starts from being made a new creature in Christ now.

**The Spirit placed in our hearts**

Well, how are we holy ones? We have the Holy Spirit within us. God's own character now is at the core of who we are and defines who we are and what the character is we will grow into more and more. The spirit in a person is the motivating agent or factor. We use it in a generic secular sense, talking about the spirit of an angry mob. What do we mean? The intent that they had in common, the outlook that they had, the purpose that they were striving after. And that's what the Holy Spirit does.

The Holy Spirit is placed, as we were told in Romans 5, beginning among many other places, is placed in us at our heart. Now, it's not talking about our physiological heart, our anatomical heart. It's talking about what that corresponds to in the spiritual reality, but the seat of motivation, of will, and where our objectives arise from. We get a clue to the typology of human anatomy and physiology in the declaration to Noah at the time of God establishing his covenant with Noah, where he proclaims the prohibition of murder and after all the violence that the flood needed to put a limit to where he says when you eat and he's instituting eating meat for human beings when you eat you must not eat it with the blood.

Now part of that is in pagan practice, people would drink the blood of the sacrificed animal with the idea that they were taking the life of the sacrificed animal into them and were acquiring the attributes of that kind of animal. So that's part of what that is about. But he says you're not to eat the blood because that is the life. And carrying that on, we are not to eat flesh the way predatory animals eat flesh. They eat the flesh of living animals. They tear them apart and chew it up and in the process kill the animal. And the Lord says, kill, then eat. And so out of that, that's the first clue, and then there's a lot that follows from that.

If the blood is the life that circulates throughout the body, what's the heart? The heart is the driving force of the blood, and thus, in the typology, the driving force of life. And so having the Holy Spirit in our heart means that what now motivates and drives our life from the core of our being is the spirit of God. And that issues progressively in our coming to trust God more and more and cooperate with God more and more and live out the life of God more and more and grow to be more and more righteous in practice and better and better models helping people to see what's possible in this fallen world.

**Hope and New Life by the Spirit**

Steve mentioned Romans 5, and it's Romans 5:5. Hope does not disappoint, and this is hope for growth into showing forth the Lord. It's the hope of the glory of God. It's the hope that we will become beings who glorify God, who show people the reality and the wonder of who the true God is. Brings his beautiful, strong character to other people. So it's 

> Hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.

And also, of course, we have 2 Corinthians 5:17. 

> If any man is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things are passed away. Behold, new things have come. 

And so each of us, when we receive the Lord, become a new creation, a creation where God himself from outside the system injects his own life into us. And that's the core of who we are now and who we will grow into.

So yes, we still sin and stumble, but we're growing in our thinking and words and actions to welcome the Lord's Spirit out into where he is visible in each one of us more and more, where we get to bring the presence of Christ to people, whether they're a store clerk or over the phone or on the road or wherever you are, or the family where it's easy to let the worst hang out. I want to go home and just relax. And it's usually the worst that comes out. We're not relaxing in the spirit. We're relaxing in the flesh. And instead, I get to come bringing the, the, who I am now, the new creation, the Lord Spirit himself, his life, more and more to the people that the Lord gives me around me and to situations.

And remember with the Corinthian church, if they were on the far, far fringes of sexual promiscuity for the pagan world, there was the term Corinthianize, which meant just sexual everything. As soon as you could, it didn't matter what sex, whether you were married or not, et cetera, et cetera. If the plumbing worked, you had to be using it or you were not living a healthy, proper life. And they criticized Paul because he was not sexually active, one of their ways of trying to discredit the teacher. But if he can say that the Corinthians are new creations, we definitely fall in that category.

**Hope for real growth**

So notice if the letter is addressed to all the saints, all those set apart in Philippi. And then notice... Sorry, one more point. If you know that you are a new creation, that you are a holy one because of the Holy Spirit dwelling in you, then there is so much hope because I'm becoming and developing into who I am. I'm not trying to become who I'm not.

If I feel like, well, I'm just actually hopeless. It's just the old. That's all I can ever expect. And I will just continue to walk the old and make micro progress. But if I rejoice with the Lord and thank him that I am his new creation, that I have his beautiful, strong character within me, and that defines who I now am, then I'm and then welcome growing into in my thinking and words and actions, reflecting who I now am, letting the spirit cleanse the temple and fill those spaces. It's encouragement all the way and hope all the way.

Even if I just regress to an old pattern, it's temporary and it's not who I am. It's not a reflection of, oh, well, God says I'm different, but I really am not. Well, the inertia is there. The history is there. We can always go back to the old. But as we've had so many people say, even when I do, my heart isn't in it. And I don't really want to be doing it. I'm going, oh, yeah, how did I end up here again? Because the more you grow, the more you know and have the documentation of who you now are. And so do people around you.

And if the contrast is a big one, it always is with each of us. It's in different ways. It alerts people that the living God is here and transforms real people. Let us address to the saints, the holy ones, the new creatures in Christ. Being, literally, it's just being in Philippi. The location is immaterial. The identity, the reason it's directed to the Philippians is that's a particular aggregation of believers. But being citizens of Philippi wasn't the important thing. It was being citizens of the kingdom of heaven that was important.

**Philippians addressed to all believers**

But notice, to all of them, with Philippians, the overseers and administrators, elders and deacons. He doesn't name the leaders in the church, the people with official responsibility in the church. First, he names the general group without any distinction between one and another. It's what they have in common that's the target. Not anything they have in distinction from one another. Now, distinctions are valuable. They're important. But not for a sense of identity.

And the church is those who have the same life from the same Heavenly Father by the same Spirit. And that's what brings us together. And then, of course, we apply those resources to different tasks and different emphases and different kinds of service. But that's the important thing is what we have in common. And it's not hierarchical. Yes, Paul appointed elders and deacons in many of the new churches, people who showed wisdom and godliness. But as Steve said, it's not that they were somehow better than the others or more important than the others. It was just a different mode of being a servant of Christ and ones who would devote themselves to the word, to prayer, and to helping others to grow while they themselves are growing.

And for people out of churches and denominations where there's a big hierarchy, this is very important. It's very easy to think that somehow the person in leadership is more important instead of just a different way of being a servant of Christ.

### Verse 2

**Grace and peace**

Then the greeting itself. Grace to you and peace. Grace was the customary greeting among Hellenized people, people influenced by the Greek culture, *charis*, and peace, *shalom*, was a customary greeting among Jewish people. This was the Greek word *eirene*, but he's reflecting the Jewish greeting of *shalom*. But the Hebrew *shalom* means much more than what we think of as peace. It incorporates wholeness, wellness, well-being, and peace is part of that. People who are doing well personally, not talking about financially or that sort of thing, but people who are doing well are generally at peace. And it's the peace that comes from wholeness, wellness, not just from the absence of hostilities. Of course, that is part. But grace to you and peace, but where does it come from? Not from Greek culture or Jewish culture or tradition, but from God our Father's and the Lord Jesus Christ.

**God our Father**

God the Father is a description of God's nature, of the three members of the Godhead: Father, Son, and Spirit. The Father is the giver of life, the source of life. The Son is the administrator, and the Spirit is the developer, nurturer, giving, growing the fruit of that life in the believer. But God, our Father, in what way is God our Father? It's not just a title. It's not just a theological title. It's not just a religious title, a church thing, ecclesiastical title. It is reality. God is our father because he has given us his life.

Father is the one who's I have received and reproduced in my individual way and carry on and pass on to others. We become a child of God at the point that we accept Jesus as our Lord and Savior, accept his life, which is the life that comes ultimately from the Father. And thereby, we become children of God. We've known people who like to use "you are a child of God" as an evangelistic message. You're not a child of God because you are a creature created in the image of God. You are a creation of God and you're created in God's image. So there's a very definite link just from the fact that you exist as a human being is a very definite link with God. But it's not God as your father. It's God as your creator. And Jesus is the divine agent of the creations, as we're told in various places in Scripture, Colossians 1, for example, Hebrews 1.

But God is our father because we have his life. And notice they also refer to as the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Not that Jesus came into existence from the father, but that Jesus related, relates to the father as a father. And the moral that, that, that we will talk about it later. But God is our father. Hebrews 2, Jesus' reference to that. And John 1, verse 12 and 13. But as many as received him, received Jesus, to them he gave the right to become children of God. Yeah, to become children of God. So we are not children of God by creation. We are not born as human beings in our physical birth. We are not born children of God. We have the opportunity to become children of God by responding to the gospel. And being filled with his life.

**Grace and Peace: Key to Growth and Change**

The issue of grace, before we move on too far from grace, grace and peace is actually really important. Let's not move away from grace and peace. No, let's never run away from grace and peace or leave it behind. Grace means favor. And as Steve said, these were the typical Greek and Jewish greetings. But now Paul is using them at the beginning of almost all his epistles, filling them with meaning, that we as believers have God's favor, and we have deep peace from him. And it's from the Father and the Son.

First about the grace, it's interesting at the beginning of Colossians 1:6 says, Paul says that the gospel having, once we've received the gospel, the Colossians had, 

> which came to you just as in all the world, it is constantly bearing fruit and increasing, even as it has been doing in you also since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth. 

And it's really as we know that we have God's favor while we're growing, that we can grow. Even if we're just taking baby steps. As long as you think that God is watching out and going to throw lightning bolts as soon as you've blown it, where's your focus? On myself, on the past, even if it was two seconds ago. And I'm beating myself up. How could I do it again? God must be down on me, especially with the again type issues that as we're growing out of those, as long as I'm afraid that God is just sick and tired of me and I don't even want to go to him because I'm coming with the same thing again.

We've had so many people tell me and tell us, I feel like God must be disgusted with me because I've blown it in repeated areas. And I even am afraid to pray about it anymore because he must be so bored of what I'm coming with. And that's viewing God as the judge. And he is not our judge anymore. We do things that give him grief, for sure. But we have his favor and his deep well-being and he's not out to get us while we grow. And it's, in fact, as we learn to dwell in and welcome that, Lord, it's so amazing. I have your favor while I'm growing. And that really gives us hope and fuels us.

We are moving forward and it's a very powerful thing to proclaim. I know who you are. I know the Lord will complete what he's begun, which is where the next verse is. But you know you blew it and you just get to go to him and say, Lord, I blew it again, but thank you, 1 John 1:9. That if I agree with you, confess means to say with. It doesn't mean grovel. It just means to agree. I blew it. You say I blew it. I blew it. I agree. And he is faithful and righteous. He's right to do it because of the sacrifice of Christ to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. So forgiveness for the past, continued encouragement forward from the spirit within to keep growing into his character and that's why Romans 8 starts with there's no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus and there's no caveat on that there's no as long as you're trying hard or as long as it's a different area or anything like that it's I have his favor and as I dwell in that I then I have the confidence and the hope to grow. And I can't emphasize it enough.

And here in Colossians 1:6, Paul is saying it's as you understood the grace of God in truth, that's what fueled your growth. And so it's something to make sure to dwell in yourself, to welcome as true, and to thank him that it's true even with those repeat areas, and just put my focus on, Lord, help me to grow.

**Misconceptions About God as Father**

There are two other misconceptions regarding God as Father that we do well to set aside. One is one that I will never forget. At Urbana 73, Paul Little was the plenary speaker and moderator. And I'll never forget him. Now, Paul means small and Little, of course, means little. And Paul Little was anything but small. He was a giant. He was a mountain of a man, which made this thing that he did really good. And the way the arena we were in, the huge arena we were in, was done, you know, there's an upper section and that's where the lectern was for that he was speaking from and so it was perfect because he said many people think that God is a big ogre leaning down over the balcony rail of life and he was able to do that looking for someone who's having fun so he can cry out shut it down. You know, the killjoy. Totally false notion. Yes. God is opposed to that, to sin. Why? Because it ruins lives. It hurts us and those we impact. It's not healthy.

And the other thing to set aside is because some translations unfortunately talk about adoption as sons, people get the idea, well, I'm God's adopted child. I'm not really God's child, but God goes through some administrative legal hocus-pocus to pretend that I'm his child. That's not true. We don't have time to go into that, but those are better translated the appointment to sonship. Sonship is an office, and it is the office that any believer, human gender notwithstanding, enters into at the time of taking up mature responsibility in the kingdom of God, acting as God's agent of implementing God's will. Just to mention that, and it's really good to see that the most recent translations, more and more, are using appointment rather than adoption, which is wonderful.

One thing that is very key here is that the grace, the favor, and deep well-being is from the Father and the Son. Okay. You have probably had, we have had so many people say, well, I really like Jesus. He's my friend, but I am terrified of the Father. And Jesus saves me from the Father. And especially if their relationship with their earthly father was not good or even destructive, it's very hard. We've had many say, I just, the concept of fatherhood is a terrifying one for me. And I've worked with students who were sexually and physically abused by their fathers. And it's actually been so healing for them to realize that their earthly father was a total contrast from the heavenly father. And they now have a heavenly father who loves them.

And even right here, the declaration at the beginning of almost every one of Paul's letters, I have his favor and deep well-being from the Father as well as the Son. And that's so important. And we've also helped people whose relationship with their father was either not good or terrible to recognize that the Lord uses the contrast, if we had good fathers who reflected aspects of the Lord, that draws us toward the heavenly father and shows us who he is. And even my real father, who was a doctor in Sweden, was not a believer, but he showed me grace. And he was the one who taught me what grace is before I became a believer. And then I recognized that his grace toward me was a reflection of the guide he didn't know yet. And he wrote wonderful letters to me frequently. And I was too busy to answer most of the time. And he never chewed me out for it. He could have, because he obviously spent a lot of time as a very busy doctor, crafting these beautiful letters to me. And he did occasionally say it would be so nice even to get a postcard from you. And once in a while I did, but it's easy as a kid to just be too busy with your own life and what you're doing. And, you know, I wish I had now, but I, I didn't. And he showed me grace, as an unbeliever, but when it's a horrible contrast, when there may even be horrible destruction in that relationship, the very contrast can be an open door to the Heavenly Father.

And we've seen that with students we've worked with, where there's just that sense: it's not supposed to be that way, and there must be something else. It's part of the Lord's drawing them to the Heavenly Father, who is utterly different from what they experienced growing up. This is an example and an outworking of Romans 8:28, which most believers at least have some familiarity with, that we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love Him, called according to His purpose. It's His purpose.

Either way, every one of our fathers showed us what a father should be—either directly, to the degree that they manifested God's design for a father, or indirectly, by contrast, by making us aware that a father should be very different or much better than what we experienced. Either way, we gain a concept and desire for a real father, and that's what we have in God the Father.

**"Lord Jesus Christ"**

Now, grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. We tend just to rattle that off. Many, many people think Christ was Jesus' last name. So, the Lord Jesus Christ picks up all three aspects of who He is. Lord: He is the Lord God, one of the three in the Godhead, who in alliance in their oneness, constitute God. He is the Son: He carries the portfolio of administration, including creation and so forth. So, Lord points to His divinity; Jesus points to His humanity, that He came as the person Jesus of Nazareth, and even the name means "the Lord saves." That's what Jesus means. Then Christ is the Greek translation of the Hebrew term "Mashiach," the Anointed One, the Messiah. We transliterate it as "Messiah," the promised one who was anointed by the Spirit of God to bring salvation to the world.

**Fellowship of the Trinity**

So all those aspects of our Lord are in the person of Jesus. And grace to you and peace comes from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. Now, where's the Spirit? We have two members of the Godhead listed here at the end of verse 2. Where's the Spirit? Well, we've already noted the Spirit—the Spirit of holiness who makes us what we are: holy ones. But why the Father and the Son? Why doesn’t it say, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit"? The key to that is in the definition that Jesus gave us of eternal life, as recorded in His so-called high priestly prayer when He prays to the Father. John 17:3 records Jesus saying, 

> This is eternal life: that they may know You, the one true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

Eternal life is a relationship, again of three, just like in the Godhead—it's the relationship of three in total alliance and unity with each other: Father, Son, and Spirit. It's our intimate relationship with God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, which we are in by the agency of the Holy Spirit in us. It's not God the Father out there, Jesus out there, or the Spirit out there. It's the Father out there—not way out in space, but very intimately close.

I mean, it's about knowing—intimately knowing. It's the same as the way a husband and wife grow to know each other like nobody else. It's intimate knowledge of the Father and the Son by means of the Spirit. That is the relationship of the Trinity. But this is it being lived out not in the heavenly realm, but in the divine human realm, where we participate in the role of the Spirit. We are not the Spirit, but we have the Spirit, and that intimacy we have with the Father and Son by the Spirit living in us is the same intimacy the Father, Son, and Spirit have in heaven. So we're invited into the fellowship—the love triangle—of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, with the Spirit indwelling us.

That's an amazing invitation and welcome, and being in that position brings us as close to being God as possible without actually being God. It's just deep, intimate fellowship with the Father and Son through the Holy Spirit, and that's a wonder to keep growing in over a lifetime. The more we are, the closer we are with the Father and Son, the more joy there is, the more we dwell in that love that they all share and have shared with us, and the more we get to invite others into, or much closer into.

**Read Scripture Carefully**

As you read the teaser for tonight's class, it's the same one we sent out to the students yesterday, and we were all set to go through Philippians 1:1-11 last night. To our great surprise, we did Philippians 1:1-2, the same as we did tonight, because the Lord very clearly said, "Slow down, hold on, don't race through this. There is so much in just this salutation of the letter."

This is a wonderful encouragement to us to read scripture carefully, consider carefully, and pray through it. Don't just read it. It's very easy for us to pick up one of the New Testament letters and read over the salutation just to be responsible and read it before getting into what the letter is all about.

**Walking this in Practice**

Our encouragement to each one of us is to go back through the first two verses and thank the Lord that each thing Paul talks about, that we've talked about tonight, is true of us and also true of fellow believers—any fellow believer anywhere, but especially those with whom we have close contact, and we know the old. It's very easy to just view each other as the old person: "I know your habits, I know your weaknesses," instead of, "I know who you are at the core and who you're growing into." Knowing the habits and weaknesses is knowing who you were, and that is the backdrop for marveling at who you now are. That's the black velvet that sets off the brilliance of the diamond.

**Questions for Next Week**

Next week, we will be in the rest of Philippians 1:1-11. We'll make it that far—yeah, I think we will. But some key things you might look at ahead are: how can I pray for a fellow believer in a powerful way? And especially, as Paul will say, "with every remembrance, I'm praying with joy." On what basis can I have joy?

Everything in these first two verses is true of every believer we will ever meet, no matter how mature or how new, rough, or immature. It's very helpful. How can I pray with joy? On what basis? To know that those prayers are a powerful joining with the Lord and knowing what it's all about—knowing who this other person is and what this person's destiny is in growing.

**Father's expectations for the child**

The aspect of the Father that we didn't touch on is the Father's expectations for the child. Many have heard before about our eldest daughter Debbie's first visit to a class at Stanford. She was only two weeks old. She didn't get much out of it, except that she learned how to go through a Stanford class the way Stanford students do, and that is sleep through it. That's not true, actually—though there is a lot of sleeping in Stanford classrooms.

At that time, it was really fun. It fit right with the passage we were in—Romans—and it fit right with the passage about who we are as new creatures in Christ. I asked the class to describe and characterize a human being, and we got the classic Stanford classroom answer: "Walks upright on two feet, communicates with complex verbal language." I reached out and picked up this two-week-old baby, snuggle pack and all, and said, "Then what's this?"

No one could see any evidence whatsoever of any of the characteristics they listed, not just those two. And yet, not a single person had any question—this is a human being. That's really helpful for how we view our fellow believers—the way parents anticipate.

And by the way, let me slip in a little announcement here. Thank you for your prayers. We jumped, in the span of 45 minutes, from having one grandchild to three. The "twincesses," as Hannah has dubbed them, were delivered—Phoebe was delivered of the twin sisters. That's technically it—you don't deliver the babies; you deliver the mother from the burden of carrying the babies. Anyway, we've turned the figure in our understanding and usage.

Last Wednesday, I think we told you because it was—yeah, that's right—I guess it was that day. Yeah, we met with you right afterwards. Okay, so you already know. But they're all doing—it's still wonderful news, even if it's not new news. They're all doing very well and at home, and everything's going so well.

All the excitement about anticipating growth... we'll be getting this from Kaylee, Phoebe, and Justin. "When are they going to start talking? When are they going to start talking?" And we'll probably tell them, "Don't be in too much of a rush. Pretty soon, you're going to be asking, 'When are they going to stop talking?'"

Anyway, when are they going to walk? But all the emphasis is on hope, and realization of that hope. Any tiny evidence of realizing that hope in practice is a cause for great rejoicing.

There was a church elder who had a lot of influence in my life in a way that none of the other elders in the church had. He actually struggled because, as the elders were figuring out what each of their spiritual gifts were, he kept thinking, "I don't have any gifts. I haven't seen anything."

He had the gift of encouragement. He always saw me in terms of what the Lord was doing in my life. As a young man struggling in ministry, I would talk to him, and I didn't tell the other elders about that because they were all oriented to finding fault, which is what people typically do, including those who are very mature in the Lord. But he always saw what God was doing in spite of what the flesh might be doing. It was such an encouragement to me because he saw me the way God sees me.

**Preparation for Next Week**

In preparation for next week, read the first 11 verses of Philippians and be asking the Lord. Don't just start with verse 3; include verses 1 to 2. How can I serve as a servant of Christ in the lives of other believers, especially those I'm in long-term relationships with? It's easy to get annoyed because they haven't changed on my timetable. Instead, understand what is the power tool that the Lord gives me with prayer and how can I pray with joy and on what basis in every remembrance of this person.

There's a lot of growth here and understanding, and it's powerful. What can I expect the Lord to do in my life and the life of every other believer, no matter how rough and immature they may be at the moment or how damaged? Also, what do I pray for? We have one of Paul's prayers that's very important, especially the issue of discernment and what he is praying that will grow in. There's a lot to look at, and what about being filled with the fruit of righteousness? What is righteousness? Why doesn't it just say be righteous instead of filled with the fruit of righteousness? What's that all about?

This is very practical and has been so helpful in our marriage now, 48 years. Being able to be the Lord's servants to pray for and encourage each other, definitely not perfectly but growing, and this passage has been very helpful for us and for praying for our adult children. It's part of our premarital counseling that we always include and still have opportunities with international couples and national couples from all cultures.

> Let's pray. Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to be yours. What a wonder to be welcomed into the love triangle, the love fellowship of the Trinity, with your own life within us. Thank you that you have made us new creations at the greatest expense to you, Jesus. Thank you for the grace, the favor, and the deep well-being that is the setting from you for a lifetime of growth and for a lifetime of encouraging many others who are struggling, floundering, and despairing of growing. Thank you that we have so much hope with the base of reality from you to offer. Thank you that each of us are servants of you, Jesus Christ. Thank you for the high calling, the meaning, and the privilege of getting to join you as you are at work in us and in others in this broken world. Thank you, Lord, in your name. Amen.
