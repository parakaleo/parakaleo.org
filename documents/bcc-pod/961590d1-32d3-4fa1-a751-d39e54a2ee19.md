> Oh, Lord, thank You for those seasons when it is one big thing after another. Thank You that just as with Exodus, those very things become the place where we see You. As we trust You as Moses did, we and those around us get to see Your power, Your glory, Your care. We ask that, in the midst of all this loss, You will continue, that You will uphold Cora, that You will surround her with Your love and uphold her and encourage her in the day and the night. Thank You that among any family who don't know You, she is in this world with You and with hope because of You. You promise that You are with us always, all the way through. In this world, we have tribulation, but we take courage that You, Jesus, have overcome the world.

> Lord, please keep encouraging Cora with specific scripture that lifts her heart and with Your Holy Spirit that brings life out of death. May she be a light for her whole family. Lord, we ask for Your healing in Benjamin's family and that You would protect Benjamin and Peggy from getting sick and give them some special family time in the midst of caring for the sick. Give them joy in You and together, even in the midst of recovery. Thank You, Lord, for the burdens that all of us carry. We ask for Your healing, Your uplifting, Your encouragement tonight, Lord. Thank You that You know what each of us carry. May we learn to carry it with You or offload it to You so that we can be active in redemptive work. Thank You, Lord, in Your name. Amen.

**Handling Anxiety**

Well, it's so good to see you all. As you know, tonight we're headed into a subject that none of us are interested in: how to handle anxiety. We have certainly found, and I'm sure you have too, that life in a broken world offers us a constant menu of things to worry about and stress over. It includes real things and speculated things, what might happen. A lot of times as we fill the screen of our minds with what might happen, it starts taking on a life of its own.

It can include, among the grad students and young professionals, concerns about performance. "How am I doing versus others? What kind of doors does that open or close for the future?" All of us have concerns about, "Am I enough? Is what I'm doing enough for whatever the goal is, whoever is evaluating?" As we get older, you start adding in health issues and all of the interpersonal relations and conflict. We can also add on circumstances like weather, national / international issues, which we're all so aware of now because of the accessibility of news.

It's very easy to have the entire screen of my life, my view, focused on all the concerns. There's a premise underneath that somehow if I can be aware of what might go wrong, I can control it, which is totally false. There is almost nothing we have total control over. Even if I can control all those things, then there are all those other things that I haven't even thought about yet.

It's really a false premise. We can collect fears over life as if that's somehow our protection: if I somehow collect all these fears and at least know about them, that will somehow protect me. But it doesn't. We end up just stewing over things. We have more and more problems we're trying to solve incessantly, but we can't solve them. We can't solve what's going on internationally. We can't solve most of our health issues.

Where there are other players, you can get it all worked out in your head and then things change. When many people are involved, the other people haven't read the script that I'm writing for them. Or if they have, they don't like it, and they're acting off script. 

**The Adversary's Tactics**

Women often carry on our shoulders (and in our hearts) the concerns of all the people they know and love. The more people you know and love, the easier it is to take all those concerns on yourself. It's actually shocking, but helpful, to realize that fear, anxiety, and distraction (as we look at in the scriptures) are major tactics of our spiritual adversary to keep us focused on what is wrong or might go wrong and separate us in practice from the Lord. If you belong to Jesus, no one can snatch you out of His hands. The adversary knows that those who have given their lives to Jesus are dangerous to him. When we're full of the Lord and participating in His work, we can be a powerful force in this world and in the lives of the people we influence. [They're taking over his territory and freeing it up.]

We have been shocked, and it's helpful to know that one of the major tactics of the adversary is to use anxiety, fear, and distraction to divert our attention, grabbing it and filling our lives with what's wrong or might go wrong rather than connecting strongly with the Lord concerning those very issues.

**Fear (Hebrews 2:14-16)**

The passages we'll be looking at tonight are very helpful in this. We'll be spending three weeks on this because it's such a major topic. We're taking a quick break from Philippians and will return to Philippians 4 next week. This week, some parents of students visited, and those students weren't able to attend class, so we jumped to other powerful adjunct passages. That's what we'll be looking at tonight, and it's good preparation for going into Philippians 4.

One of the very powerful adjunct passages we've used with many people we've counseled is Hebrews 2:14-16: "Since then the children [that's all of us], share in flesh and blood, He [Jesus] Himself, likewise partook of the same that through death He might render powerless him who had the power of death, that is the devil [the devil means accuser] and He might deliver those who through fear of death were subject to slavery all their lives. For assuredly, He does not give help to angels, but He gives help to the descendants, the seed of Abraham." We're all the seed of Abraham through faith.

There's profound insight in recognizing that all of us have forms of death that we fear. It's not just physical death; it can include different kinds of experiential death: I'm afraid of being judged, shamed, or condemned. We each have areas of fear. It's helpful to identify (and you can be asking the Lord about this) what key areas of fear have lodged in our lives. As soon as anything shows up in that vicinity, it takes on a life bigger than is warranted. It can stem from culture, family, or something that you've accumulated yourself through hard experiences. Fear of physical death is one of those. For some, that's not a big fear, especially once you've come to the Lord; you may look forward to going home.

For many, any physical ailment sends off major alarm bells, "Oh no, this may precipitate something big." And the fear of death is right there in their faces. Or if it's fear of judgment, the passage about being subject to slavery through fear of death is profound. There are areas of fear where we feel out of control, and it's easy to retreat to what I consider to be a safe place. I'm not going to be with people that might be condemning or where I feel out of control. I'm not going to be where I could contract any illness (even if I don't have a major immune problem). Your life becomes smaller and smaller and smaller.

Years ago, we were with a dear lady whose life had become so small because she was progressively only staying in circumstances and with people where she felt in control and safe. She was an atheist, but there was some interest and openness. We were in a one-on-one discussion where it was appropriate for me to show her this passage and say, "Do you realize that you have built a prison for yourself because of fear? Your life has become so small and narrow because you have added bars of fear. You won't go where there's any threat of forms of death."

She acknowledged, "You're right. I have put this together bar by bar, and I do not want out." She died that way. It was tragic because I was showing her that Jesus is here to deliver her from that prison. He becomes your safe place so that you can go where you feared to go before and be with people that were difficult to be with.

**Flee to the Shepherd**

An interesting thing I learned recently is that the Greek term for fear originally derives from the word meaning to flee. This was helpful to me as a key in putting together the paradox of both the positive and negative meanings of fear: reverential fear as well as terror. The key is in that root "flee." Threatening things cause us to flee from them. Anxiety often involves trying to run from everything threatening. The answer is to flee to the security that protects usâ€”flee to the Shepherd. There are wolves around, but flee to the Shepherd, the Good Shepherd. You can flee from all the wolves and predators, but you'll have more pursuers and fewer places to flee until you flee to the One who is the answer, our security. I'm delighted in that insight.

Years ago, at a registration event, we were out with everybody with their info tables, greeting returning students and meeting new ones. One ministry handed out bookmarks that said, "In pursuit of the sheepskin, don't lose sight of the Shepherd." At that time, Stanford awarded degrees on real parchment. Erica has one genuine sheepskin Stanford diploma, and I have two for undergraduate and graduate. We had to safeguard those because replacements would not be parchment. Stanford and Oxford's demand for sheepskin vellum outstripped the world's supply, and Oxford was in line before us, so we had to yield. [Student: I had no idea that vellum was made from sheepskin. That's really interesting.]

This is part of the reason many early scrolls, like the Dead Sea Scrolls, have survived under the right conditions. They are not made from paper or papyrus but from skin. In fact, they would erase and reuse parchment by scraping the ink off or dissolving it, then wiping it clean. Scholars can look at the traces of what was previously written, which is sometimes very helpful.

**A Student Example**

Student: I wonder if I could share something that to me is an application of what you're talking about. I told you my niece died. Her older sister, stepsister really, is a person who just likes to be ornery and give her opinion whether you like it or not. She had to let me know.

She's the poster child for the t-shirt that says, "I love my attitude problem." That's where some of the stress and tension has been in these things. I was so irritated with her over her attitude about her younger sister's situation. I get irritated with her all the time anyway. When my brother died, she also was the one that made the phone call to me. I wasn't irritated at her then.

A few days later (this is illustrating to me what you were talking about - overcoming anxiety and trusting the Lord and stepping out and doing the thing you don't want to do or that you're afraid to do), I didn't want to call her because I didn't want to hear her "stuff." I was praying about it. "What should I do?" (I liked my attitude problem too at that point.) God just said, "You need to call her and tell her that you appreciate that twice in the last six weeks she has had to be the one to call and tell family members that somebody has died." That really touched me to think about it from her point of view. I did. I called her.

At first, she was not friendly. But I said, "I'm just calling to tell you that I really appreciate the fact that you have been the one to give us all this bad news so close together, just six weeks." Boy, did her attitude soften. She thanked me for saying that. We kind of went on and had a decent conversation.

I would have ordinarily just wanted to avoid talking to her; but I'm so glad I did. It was a blessing to me that I obeyed, for one thing. We now have, I think, a better relationship because of that, because it softened her. That's coming to mind when you were talking about this. Be there and don't be afraid to be kind. Don't be afraid to reach out to that other person that's so difficult. [Steve: That's a beautiful example of not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead. {Erica: 1 Peter 3:9} A very good example of that.]

I just shared it because everybody here knows it wasn't my initial thing. It wasn't my flesh. I was grieving for my brother.

No**t Returning Evil For Evil**

But the Lord and the Spirit stepped in and enabled you to do what the flesh wouldn't let you do, wouldn't be willing to do. That's beautiful. It's crossing through that invisible barrier that the Lord has come to deliver us from. Then we get to be part of His work, and it's so exciting.

Steve mentioned the 1 Peter 3 chapter. In verses 8 and 9: "To sum up, let all be harmonious, sympathetic, brotherly, kind-hearted, humble in spirit, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead for you were called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing."

We get incredibly blessed as we trust Him to offer these things, especially when they're not deserved. When it's not what you've been getting on the receiving end, I have the boldness to do it because the Lord dearly loves this difficult person and dearly loves me. I get to be part of it rather than just reacting to them. Then I'm excited. I'm lifted up. That's a beautiful example. He came to deliver us from being controlled by the fear of death and you just lived that out. 

**Scattered Seeds**

Another passage that has been very helpful in this area is 1 Peter 5, starting in verse 6, to the end of the chapter. Peter wrote the letter we call 1 Peter to believers scattered throughout the Roman Empire due to persecution. They had lost their ancestral homes, neighbors, and family members. The English word used at the beginning of the letter is "scattered," but the Greek word is "seeded." They were scattered by persecution. That's what people were doing. But the reality was the Lord was seeding them throughout the Roman Empire as a light of His presence.

It was hard; they had lost everything, like modern refugees from Syria and Sudan. They lost their community and were not with people who spoke the same language. All of their cultural instincts were different, making them feel like aliens. Especially at that time, people didn't move much. Now our world is a little more fluid, but it's still easy to feel like an outsider when landing in other places, especially not by choice.

**Humble Yourselves; He Cares For You**

1 Peter is a letter of hope to people who've experienced huge loss. There's potential and opportunity for worry and fear through circumstances we would not have chosen. A lot of life includes things we would not have chosen. His counsel is helpful in that. Starting in 1 Peter 5:6, "Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety upon Him because He cares for you."

Instead of fighting, grumbling, or spending huge amounts of energy wishing to be elsewhere, back to what was comfortable (though never perfect) before, welcome what the Lord has called you to. Not because all of it is goodâ€”it's not. It's a broken world, and we're not in heaven yet. But know that He promises to cause it to work together for tremendous good. We have that promise from Romans 8:28. We forget verses 29 and 30, which explain how He uses it to grow us into His image, to conform us to His image. We grow in His glory, showing Him forth wherever we're called to be and in whosever company we're called to be.

Instead of fighting it, grumbling over it, just dragging my feet through it, I choose to welcome it from His hand. Knowing the promise, He will exalt me. He will lift me up. That's His promise. Other people around probably won't, but it's what He promises to do as I welcome where He's called me to walk.

Maybe it's difficult co-workers, neighbors, or relatives. We've all got people we would probably prefer not to spend time with, but there they are. "Thank you, Lord, for the mix." How do I do that? "Casting all my anxiety upon Him because He cares for you." The word anxiety in the Greek means a distracting care or fear. The anxiety distracts me away from the Lord. It tends to fill the screen of my life, and I am entirely focused there trying to fight it, trying to figure out what to do, trying to control this thing. We tend to be consumed by that unsolved issue, and it can go for years or a lifetime.

He's saying, what do I do with those very real concerns? Some of them are speculation, but a lot of them are real. In Exodus, no water, that's a real issue. No food, that's a real issue. Amalekites attacking, that's a real issue. What do I do with those very real issues? Instead of carrying it, instead of trying to solve it myself, cast it on the One who cares for you. He's my safe place.

**Entrust Yourself to Him**

We'll be looking in Philippians 4 next week. Instead of letting those issues grab my entire attention, let them become a stimulus to jump into the Lord's lap and tell Him all about it. Entrust it to Him instead of holding onto it as if it's a treasure to try to figure out. We're all puzzle solvers. Somehow I imagine, "If I think about it enough, I'll solve this one." Probably not. But I keep thinking I will. Instead, entrust it to the One who cares for you and who is the answer.

An image of this comes to mind. I remember a story told by one of the pastors who was very influential in my equipping about a time that he had to take something to a neighbor's house. He took his little boy with him. It was a nice day, and he was wearing short pants. There at the door, the people had a dog who decided that it was not pleased they were there and was threatening them. The little boy was climbing up into daddy's arms for protection from the dog. The dog did attack. He shared, "There I was with a dog chewing on one ankle and my little boy climbing up the other leg." The little boy knew where security was. He knew his father would protect him from the dog. And his father did, even at his own expense as the dog chewed on his bare leg.

Cast your anxiety on Him. Cast yourself on Him, along with all the anxiety, because He cares for you. It's a very interesting statement in Greek. "to Him, it is (or there is) a care about you or surrounding you." Everything to do with us, is a care to Him. And that's an encouragement. It's not a burdensome care, it's a privilege. We're dearly loved, and He is a present Good Shepherd who cares.

**A Student's Helpful Reminder**

Student: A quick comment. I put in my phone as a reoccurring thing I heard from a sermon: "Let your emotions be an indicator, not a dictator."

They can be an alert. It's time to jump into the Lord's lap or shinny up His leg, where I want to live proactively. But if I've gotten focused on the fears, it's a wake-up call to jump back in His lap or up His leg to go flee to the Shepherd and dwell there in His care.

**Not Ignorant of the Devil's Schemes**

He says, "Be of sober spirit, be on the alert. Your adversary, the devil, prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour." So he's saying, "Know the tactics." Don't act as if there's no adversary around, because there is. You have an active adversary who's really the Lord's adversary, but he can't get at Him, so he tries to get at His people. And we're His people; he tries to get at His beloved.

The roaring is his barrage of accusations and fears, which takes our attention off the Lord and is designed to cause us to think that the Lord has no interest in us because we're such a piece of garbage. It's exactly the opposite. The Lord cares for us because of all the garbage that He's eager to set us free from.

Paul talks about this in II Corinthians 2:11 that we're not ignorant of the devil's schemes. We know the typical tactics of the adversary and paralyzing through fear is one of them. It's a standard tactic of the adversary. Lions roar to paralyze dinner with fear so dinner won't run away. That's how the adversary loves to use fear in our lives to entirely grab our attention. "In order that no advantage be taken of us by Satan, for we're not ignorant of his schemes." And it's in the context of forgiveness. We know typical ploys he tries; he can't have us; but he tries to weaken us so that we're not powerful allies of the Lord. One of his major typical ploys is to use worry and fear to distract us away from the Lord, and accusations of guilt and failure, etc.

It's helpful to know, to recognize, when these emotions hit us, "This is a tactic of the adversary to separate me from the Shepherd, and I don't have to give into it." In fact, I can turn that very stimulus into a reminder. I want to jump to the Lord. I've lost sight of Him at the moment. I got grabbed by this concern for myself or someone else. I want to jump to the Lord. I need Him, not only for protection, but also for wisdom to know, "How can I help? How can I be a proactive part of His work?"

**We're Not In Control**

Student: I was just thinking about what you just said, that when we're caught up in all of that stuff, worry, fear, anxiety, especially when we have no control, it's so futile. I really have found that when I can exercise what you're talking about, being willing to let go, all of a sudden, I see all kinds of things that I do have control over that need to be done, like even just praying. It keeps us on a merry-go-round.

One current example is, I've been in endless conversations with people who are terrified, angry, upset about what's going on nationally and internationally. Can any of us control any of that? No. We can have our say, but it's a little bit. As long as I stay angry and afraid, I am not doing the most powerful thing, which is prayer.

We actually encourage people, don't spend all your time on the news. You're filling the screen of your mind with everything to grab your attention and worry about. Know enough to pray from. Prayer is a powerful tool that we have, no matter where you are politically, no matter what you think about any of these affairs, the Lord calls us to pray for those who are in government. Nero was on the throne at that point. He was one of the most despicable tyrants who's ever lived, and the Lord was calling on His people to pray for Nero. We know that Paul's case would have been presented before Nero; so Nero had his chance to hear the gospel. That displays the Lord's love. We have something powerful we can do.

**PRAY**

One more example, we were in Romania serving just as the wall came down. We have pieces of the Berlin Wall because we were going through to teach in East Germany right then. [Steve: That was a tender spot in my memory because decades before, I had spent my 21st birthday detained by the East German border police at checkpoint Charlie. Erica: For hours while others were being passed through, here's this young Westerner being detained. But he was reading all their propaganda. Steve: I don't know whether they had in mind the significance to an American kid of his 21st birthday. If so, anyway, it doesn't matter.]

The point was: the Romanians would take their one day off and go up to mountaintops and pray over their country all day. It was under heavy, heavy Soviet oppression for 40 years. When the Lord lifted that, it was almost without a shot. We could cite so many other examples. Prayer is a very powerful tool that the Lord puts in our hands to be part of His work, His powerful work. Rather than griping and complaining and fearing and getting angry, be part of His work through prayer.

As Erica said, don't get buried in the news. Immerse yourself in the good news, the answer to the bad news that gets broadcast nonstop. I try to know just enough to pray from, and I don't need to be buried in the rest. It blocks me from being effective where I do have opportunity. That is because people do get dragged down by being affected by the news when they can be affecting what the news is reporting. Treat it as a prayer list.

The amazing thing is I can do it from any distance, at any location, at any time. Of course, we don't begin to take advantage of that powerful resource. What we actually do is only a beginning of what we could do. But it is a beginning. I just have to read you a quote that I have on the refrigerator here by Alfred Lord Tennyson: "More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of." That's Alfred Lord Tennyson, someone who knew.

Back to the passage, here he says: I know what this tactic is about. It's helpful to think of worry and fear as a distraction away from the Lord and recognize that it's a tactic of my spiritual adversary. Then when it hits, instead of being caught by it, I say, "Oh, I know what's going on." It's a stimulus to jump to the One who has the answers where I can be part of His powerful work instead of getting pulled away.

I was part of teaching a seminar on prayer many years ago and found myself saying, (and I sincerely believe it though I have not acted on it nearly as much as I would like to, but I believe it really is true): "If it's worth thinking about, it's worth praying about." We have a sign up around our house and office: "ASAP, always stop and pray" (a good acronym).

**Resist the Devil; Run to God**

He says, know the tactic, know where it's from, but resist him, the adversary. How do I resist? Not a showdown. I resist by being firm in faith. I resist. And he's trying to keep me from trusting God. So it's by doing exactly what he's trying to keep me from doing that I resist him. I turn from the worry to being firm in faith. That's my safe place. That's my Rock, trusting the Lord.

I remember we heard the story of a little boy who was in a shipwreck and in the morning he was rescued from a big rock where he had been clinging all night. When they got him on shipboard, they asked him, "Weren't you afraid?" He answered, "Oh, yes, I was so afraid. But I clung to the rock and the rock stood firm." And that's us. We get to cling to the Rock, which is Jesus, and the Rock stands firm.

David, in many Psalms, talks about the stronghold, Masada, this monolith rock that rises about a thousand feet above the Dead Sea, where David holed up and many others. It's impressive. We've been there. He's saying the way that I resist this is by being firm in faith. That's where I go. That's where I live. "Lord, I'm out of control, but You're not."

**"Flip the Telescope"**

In a way, we think of this as "flipping the telescope." A lot of times, our fears and concerns loom huge, and the Lord seems so small as I'm bringing these things to Him because I've filled the screen with what's immediate and present, things I care about. This is a part of "flipping the telescope" to what is actually true: that the issues are quite small compared with the Lord who created the universe and manages it. We get pictures from the web. Out in deep space, there are beautiful galaxies. We know the Creator who manages all that; He can manage these concerns. It's really a "flipping of the telescope" to see who is the powerful reality here that I can count on.

Part of how you do that: it's not very powerful to simply say, "Oh, Jesus loves you." That's kind of like, "Cheer up, Jesus loves you." And you're saying, "Yeah, I know the theory. I know the theology. I've told people that. But it doesn't seem very powerful at the moment." 

You can't trust someone you don't really have in view. Instead of trying to make myself trust, I get Jesus in view, read His words, read Acts, see how He works, explore Old Testament biographies. See the Lord over the shoulders of David, Samuel, or Elijah, because that's the One that I'm trusting. It helps as I see Him at work in the lives of others in difficult situations; it enables me to trust for my own situation.

It's not about trying to force yourself to trust with repeated phrases like, "Just trust God. Just trust God. Just trust God." That's very weak. But if I have specific promises or stories that I turn to where I see the God I'm trusting at work in real-life circumstances bigger than mine, it helps so much for me to be able to entrust the concerns on my heart to Him. People often say, "I wish I had your faith." You can. Faith is not something you wait to receive from heaven. Faith is not an act of initiative. It's an act of response to the truth, love, and resources made evident. It's accepting an invitation, welcoming an offer.

**Scriptural Promises**

I encourage you to collect different parts of Scripture. I tend to put specific scripture in a journal to turn to when I'm weak and having trouble trusting. Two scriptures that have come to mind many times this week include the last verse of Matthew: "Lo, I am with you always to the end [all the way through the end] of the age." And that is literally true: He is always with us, just as tangibly as any person. We have people sitting here in this class in 13 different locations, and He is in every one of those locations with each of us.

The appearances of Jesus to the disciples after the resurrection were not to demonstrate that His resurrection body enabled Him to walk through walls. He was letting the disciples see that He was present at times when they were not aware He was present. He showed Himself and then receded from sight, but He didn't leave. They didn't see Him walk out the door or through the wall; they just didn't see Him anymore. At another point in time, He would let them see Him again, showing that He was actually there. He is always with us, always available.

In chapter 4, the resource will be committed to us. "The Lord is at hand." The Lord is right here. In Philippians 4, next week we will explore what to do when there's interpersonal conflict. It's not just the people involved in the conflict who are present; Jesus is also present. The problem is here, and so is the answer. The answer is in a Person.

Another scripture that I have kept revisiting all week is from John 16:33: "These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation. [It's a broken world.] But take courage; I have overcome the world." This is a wonderful promise to walk in and dwell in.

In Romans 8:26, when we're weak, we're prayed for by the Spirit. As stated in Romans 8:1, instead of being condemned, there is no condemnation. We're not only interceded for by the Spirit, in 8:34, the Son intercedes as well. We're covered by the Spirit and the Son. When we're overwhelmed and don't know what to do, we're interceded for before the throne of grace. Nothing, neither death nor life nor angels nor any other created thing, can separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus (8:38-39).

Romans 8:24 onward is a place of tremendous comfort and hope, no matter what circumstances fill our minds with concern and fear. It's a wonderful place to go. We're providing scriptures not only for your own life but to share with others. We have many opportunities to come alongside fearful and anxious people. It helps to have specific scriptures to help them rest. Just "God loves you" is weak. Paraphrases don't suffice. The fact is strong, but the statement is weak. It's true, but it's not much of a comfort. When I have specific promises, combined with the Spirit, it lifts us up. Collect them, go to them yourself, and share them with others.

**The Lord's Purpose in Suffering**

To finish, Peter 4:9 says, I'm resisting instead of giving in to fears and anxieties. Firm in the faith, I'm dwelling, trusting Him, "knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished by your brethren who are in the world." We're not just called to be dragged through, to cope; we're called to victorious living in the Lord, taking charge of our emotions and focus, taking charge of what I bring into a situation. I can't control others, but I can be part of putting the Lord in control of me.

This is the Lord accomplishing something. The Lord and I are going through these seasons I would never sign up for, but here we are. And so, "Thank you, Lord, help me to walk with You, dwell in You." As I'm growing in trusting Him, other people get to see Him over my shoulder. As we were talking about in Exodus, if it were just the people, they would have run back to slavery in Egypt. "Oh, the leeks and onions were so good," forgetting everything else.

The Lord caused the pillar of fire, a fiery cloud, to move around behind them. That provided a barrier against the Egyptian army coming with all their chariots. It also provided a barrier against the Israelites turning back. He's gracious. He protects our rear guard and boots us in the rear at the same time.

As I am trusting Him, as Moses trusted Him, all of us through the centuries get to see God at work. As I trust the Lord, instead of letting myself be consumed by fear, others around me will get to see the Lord as well as me. We're always being watched more than we know. We will have opportunities to share as people share where they're overwhelmed. We get to share, "I understand; I'm groaning with you. This happened. I trusted the Lord. And this is what the Lord did." It can be such encouragement to somebody else who's in the midst of suffering. You're not just being dragged through. You're accomplishing something with the Lord. You've got lots of other company because lots of people are struggling with health issues, interpersonal relationship issues, conflict, etc. For every human issue, a lot of us share it.

**Our Testimony**

Hebrews 11:1 says, "Faith is the substance of things hoped for." As I trust the Lord, it becomes "the evidence of things not seen." God shows up and works. I'm trusting Him.

Some translations say "gained approval." It literally says "gained a testimony." By trusting God for what He promises, we make His willingness to fulfill His promise visible because He does fulfill the promise and observers see it. As we trust the Lord, we get to tell about it. That's the testimony.

There's a lot more that the Lord is accomplishing that starts with fear and distraction. But as we jump into the Lord's lap and entrust it to Him and go with Him, He is doing so much in a lot of people, not just you. Peter4:10 finishes with saying, "After you've suffered for a little while...." That's not encouraging. None of us like suffering. Jesus didn't like suffering. We know that from Gethsemane, He would have preferred not to: "Is there any other way than the cross, Lord?"

When you're suffering, the clock seems to stand still. But He says, "After you've suffered for a little while," and though it seems like it's going to go on forever, He will actually limit it to what is beneficial for my growth in trust and for His working so that He is visible to me and to many others.

**God Has the Last Word**

"After you've suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, of all favor, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ...." He has called you to share in His beautiful character. That glory is showing forth His character so that my life becomes a pointer to Him. It's full of His beautiful character more and more as I trust Him. And hopefully, that is contagious. People want to know what it is and ask, "How can I get that too?" I keep having that more and more, not because I'm perfect, but because the Lord shows forth and people are hungry for that kind of life and hope with compassion.

He called you to His eternal glory in Christ. "He will himself [and this is a promise], perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. To Him be the glory, the dominion forever and ever." He has the last word, not the fears, not the other people, not even my own weakness; but He completes what He begins. More and more of His character will show forth. And the more I trust Him, the faster that will happen. I will experience the Lord Himself perfecting and maturing me. He's maturing, confirming, strengthening, and establishing you. And He is the one in charge.

That's so encouraging. It really gives a totally different perspective on the things we fear, the things that grab us. It's very helpful, too, to ask the Lord, "What are my specific fears that tend to grab me?" We each have "pet fears" that suddenly loom bigger than life. And as soon as it shows up, any little bit of it, it tends to fill the entire screen. Ask the Lord for answers from His word so that you can go there when it comes. Go there proactively to trust Him so that the adversary can't grab you there anymore.

**Scriptural Answers for Specific Fears**

At one point, I was really afraid of earthquakes. We live about a mile from the San Andreas Fault, and everybody has been predicting that it's way overdue for a major movement. My folks' place up on the Olympic Peninsula seemed wonderful because they don't have earthquakes. Then we learned that seismic geologists think the subduction of the San Juan plate under the Pacific plate is long overdue. That's not just going to rattle windows. If that happens, it will completely remake the whole terrain because it's not like sliding one book under another.

The only safe place is with the Lord, and He's everywhere. We went down to Houston, Texas for a wedding, and we couldn't believe it. The highest things on the horizon are freeway overpasses because it's so flat. Their overpasses are ribbons of concrete standing on toothpicks. You'd never have that in this area. They'd totally collapse in a not very big earthquake; but they don't think in terms of earthquakes because they don't typically have them. There are earthquake faults running right through the area; but they just haven't been active recently.

I was praying as I got caught with fear and finding out about the subduction. The Lord answered specifically with Psalm 46 "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth should change, though the mountains slip into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake at its swelling pride." He addressed exactly what I was afraid of. Then it says, "There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy dwelling places of the Most High. God is in the midst of her, she will not be moved; God will help her when morning dawns. The nations made an uproar, the kingdoms tottered. [So what's going on internationally?] He raised His voice, the earth melted. The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. Come behold the works of the Lord."

He answered me very specifically, and it was a place where I could say, "Okay. Thank you, Lord. Even if the earth changes, You're still my safe place." It doesn't mean we won't go through suffering, but He is there, and I can count on that. He will care for us and show us what to do, or it's a quick trip home to be with Him. That's not a bad thing either.

As you identify specific areas that are "pet fears" taking over the horizon of your life, ask the Lord to show you specific scriptures that address them. We'll explore this more in a future week, looking at what's underneath the fear. For example, due to cultural backgrounds, some students are terrified of not doing well enough. Culturally, success means having a profession with a good income, a big house in the Bay Area which is so expensive, and kids in private schools. Their worth depends on fulfilling that cultural dream of success, and they're terrified they won't succeed and they're driven by it.

One couple pregnant for the first time asked if they could start educating while the child was still in the womb. They felt that once the child was out, it wasn't soon enough to get an edge. We advised them that the freedom to be a child is important and promotes creativity, suggesting they put things in perspective.

Fears related to earthquakes struck me today, as Erica mentioned. My grandparents went through the 1906 earthquake and turned out well. We came into existence after they'd gone through that. This illustrates a key principle in Scripture: if you're afraid of something, find someone who has gone through that kind of experience with the Lord and let them tell you about how the Lord sustained them through it. This is how we trust in God and obtain a testimony, as seen in the beginning of Hebrews 11. As we trust God, we gain the ability to tell others about the Lord's faithfulness in areas causing them anxiety, distress, worry, and fear.

**Go to the Core**

Ask the Lord for one area in your life that tends to grab your attention, where if it shows up, it fills the screen of your life. Ask the Lord, "What's behind it. What's the fear? What is the idol? What have I decided I must have or must experience for life to be good? Or what looks like a disaster I must avoid?" Often, without realizing it, these decisions run your life when they show up, even in a minor form. You can deal with it at the core instead of waiting until it hits next time and having to put out fires repeatedly. Deal with the supply. Go to the core of it and ask the Lord to show you, "What do You call me to instead?" This is very powerful for actually changing so the adversary can't use that area anymore to get at you once you've really settled it with the Lord.

Next week, we'll get into Philippians 4. Let's pray.

> Lord Jesus, thank You that You are our strong deliverer. You are our Good Shepherd. You are always, always, always with us. You are the God of grace, the God of favor. You have called us to Your eternal glory in Christ. We are Yours. We're citizens of heaven. We get to bring heaven to earth as we trust You in the midst of a broken world and partner with You. 
>
> Thank You that as we avail ourselves of Your power that broke the power of the adversary to hold us in captivity through fear, we can instead just walk through those bars and walk with You, being part of Your powerful work in a broken world instead of being overcome by it. Thank You, Lord, for each one here. Lord, You know the burdens of our hearts for ourselves and for loved ones. Thank You that You are there to turn to in prayer with thanksgiving for what You will do. And show us how to pray and serve actively where we have the opportunity to bring You to the people and circumstances of our lives. Thank You that You give us powerful agency all the time. There's so much we can do, even though there's much that we're not in control of, but You are. Thank You, Lord, in Your name. Amen.
