Let's pray and get into the riches. 

> Oh, Lord, thank you so much that wherever we are, we have the privilege of meeting with you, of knowing you, of walking with you, our God. Thank you that you're a God of love and compassion and not just power, but that you are a God of power and justice as well. We ask, Lord God, that you will speak to each of us. Lord, may we see you more completely and deeply. May our worship be more real through the text that we look at tonight, more immediate, so that we may walk with you, joining our thoughts and our lives with you. Thank you, Lord, for each one here. We're so thankful for each one and love each one, knowing you love them far, far more. Speak to us tonight for ourselves and for others in your name. Amen.

**Introduction**

Tonight, if you looked at the announcement, we get to look at a very special part of Philippians that has been known by many as the hymn of Christ. A lot of times when we are praying, I don't know about you, but I think it's easy for me at times to have my focus more on what I'm praying about than who I'm praying to. Paul, of course, is aware of this. In this section that we've been in, that we have designated as chapter two of Philippians, he started with the infinite resource that we have for our lives to fill up with the encouragement and exhortation of Christ, his tender consolation of love, the koinonia, the joining together, having in common the life of the Spirit and his loving us, the Lord's love from the core of his being with everything that's within him. That's our infinite resource to keep filling up with so that we have so much to give that spills out of our lives, that well of living water that springs up and flows out to bless many others.

Then he moved immediately into making his joy complete by being of the same mind, same love, one accord, mindful of one thing, not selfish ambition or empty conceit, but with humility of mind, considering one another to be more important of higher concern than self. We all know from practice, that's a whole lot easier to say than to do, especially in long-term relationships, whether it's marriage, family, church, missions, workplace with other believers. It's really the challenge of a lifetime to join together our minds with the Lord, our focus, and then the unity with one another. That is a radical expression of the Lord in a broken world, because as we all know, you get human beings together in unity from the heart, is not at all normal, especially for the long run. The news is full of it, whether you're talking nationally or internationally. Counselors like us are very aware of it all the time, but all of us are. He knows that, and the Lord knows that we need more encouragement and deeper encouragement.

**Hymn of Christ**

Paul was inspired by the Holy Spirit to write this section: where do I focus my mind? He starts in verse five: "Think this way among yourselves." To have unity with the Lord and with other believers, it requires truly having the Lord Himself in view. This passage is known as the hymn of Christ by many, containing stirring poetry that many see in it. As we read it together, look for what is the flow of this passage, and what are key terms, and where are similarities and contrasts, and there's a powerful flow here. It's the paradigm of genuine spiritual progress that we see in Jesus—not selfish ambition or pride, but living out of deep love of God and neighbor and shown in practice. There's a progression here that is actually very dramatic once you begin to grasp it. I'm tracing His pre-existence, incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension. We'll be looking at elements of this: not to add to our theology knowledge, but where he's encouraging us to focus for encouragement in our own lives. And to really have in view much more deeply, who am I actually joining with? And who am I actually praying to? And who am I joining? I am filled with His inner life by the Holy Spirit, but how do I think as He thinks and act in a way that really represents Him with the people that are closest to me, the ones that are the hardest to do that with for the long run?

> "Think this among yourselves, as in Christ Jesus, who, existing in true form as God, does not consider equality with God a treasure to be clutched, but empties Himself, taking the true form of a bondservant, taking on the likeness of human nature, and being thus observed via the familiar form of a human being, and humbles Himself, becoming obedient as far as death or over death on a cross. Therefore God raises Him exceedingly and gives Him freely the name above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."

**Class discussion: reflecting on the poem**

What do you see of the flow and what keywords do you see where there's similarity and contrast? See if you can unpack a bit of this and just have fun together with it for a few minutes. 

> There's a lot of discussion of what I think of as vertical descriptions: low, humble, humility, emptied himself. Don't grasp onto things, and then exalted above every name, other people bowing down, low to high. When low in the form of man, He is obedient to the servant and things described as the low, dying on the cross. But then when described in the heavenly things, it's exalted in the name above every name. So it's from the very low to the very high.

Anything else including keys, similar terms? 

> What I'm thinking of as I'm reading it is passages this dense, just so much squeezed into five or six or seven verses. I find I really have to sit down and write it out, like in school, we used to have to diagram a sentence, the main thought, and then which thoughts come under, and then what's the next main. I haven't done that with this for a long time, but that's what I want to do now. But you two ladies that commented, I couldn't have verbalized that, but it really helps me to do that.

The low part, it's the actor, the initiator is Jesus. He emptied Himself. He did not regard equality. The exalted, the actor is God. As this is put before us as an example for us, we see Jesus' free will in walking this path with His focus on the Father, but it's free will. This isn't duty where you're hating it on the inside. This is joining His will with the Father to walk the path of love.

He's given us some instructions in the early part of chapter two. And then He says, have this attitude, but then He's talking about Jesus' attitude. It's not ours. You expect more instructions like do this, do that, have this, be kind, whatever. But no, He says, okay, this is what you do. And then He only talks about what Jesus did and how God is going to use Jesus or exalt Him. To say, have this attitude in yourselves, that's, I guess in my early years as a Christian, I would have thought, "okay, I can do that". Yes, that level of humility and servant heart.

> I remember when I was young, in sixth grade, during a communion class, we read the Sermon on the Mount, and I thought "I can do all this!" What a joke. It showed I didn't know myself and hadn't lived enough life yet. I will confess, for many years as a Christian, I thought, okay, I want to do it right. I want to just be a good Christian. I want to do everything for God. I can do that. I'm trying to copy Jesus, but that's not what it is. It's Him in me. It took many years to get that through my head and that's the power in the life of this, not just getting out there and doing it. I saw Him more as a role model than a power within myself. He's really the model, but He's also the one who fills and enables it by the Spirit. He's our forerunner, our example. He's our guide. He's our enabler. And He's the goal. He's "the way, the truth, and the life," all of it together.

>  It says, "He emptied Himself," and for this reason, God highly exalted Him. So God is the one who's exalting Him. Jesus isn't exalting Himself. God is exalting Him because of His humility in emptying Himself, just the opposite of the selfish ambition and empty conceit.

Peter tells us the same thing in 1 Peter 5: "Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in the proper time." Total contrast to people who are pursuing self-aggrandizement; they want to exalt themselves, and all the people around them want to humble them.

He has been saying that we're to be of one mind with the Lord and each other. How are we going to do that? Think this way among yourselves. As with Jesus, I'm joining. I get to know more deeply how He approached things and join my mind, my inner life with Him so that it's Him that I bring and exalt, as Paul talked about, through my life, my body.

**Jesus' true form as God**

"Think this way among yourselves as in Christ Jesus, who existing in His true form as God..." Starting right there, He empties Himself and takes up the true form of a bondservant of God. It's the same word, morphe, which is not just an outward form. It characterizes the inner life of who He was in fact. It's the reality of who He is. He existed in the reality of who He was as God. Paul is bringing up the pre-existent Christ, that He has always been there with the Father.

It's interesting that some Jewish rabbis before the time of Jesus suspected that there might be another member of the Godhead. However, as soon as Jesus appeared, that completely disappeared from their writings. Looking at Genesis 2, "let us make man in Our image," and the Spirit is there. So you really have a number of players. The honest ones were recognizing that there might be, and we know that there was, that Jesus has always been. That's where Paul starts with the majesty of who He was.

Jesus refers to this in John, in His high priestly prayer before going to the cross, John 17:5 "And now glorify me together with yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world was." He's saying, I was with the Father with His full glory before the world was. In that same prayer in verse 24, John 17:24 says: "Father, I desire that they also whom you've given me be with me where I am in order that they may behold my glory, which you have given me for you loved me before the foundation of the world." Of course, we know He's said "before Abraham was, I am".

He's not a recent newcomer to the stage. He has always been. The reminder of this—even though I know it and have taught it—is focusing on the majesty of who He is as King of the universe, the one who set the stars in place... We know from John 1 and Colossians 1 that Jesus was actually the one who did the creating. Seeing Him in His majesty, and it's almost a bit humorous, but you catch a glimpse of the majesty in Job, chapter 38, where the Lord is talking to Job after his so-called friends, tormentors, had taken him on. Finally, the Lord Himself shows up in Job 38 and speaks directly and says to Job, starting in verse 4. The whole chapter is magnificent, realizing it's Jesus who did all this.

"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, you who have understanding, who set its measurements since you know? Or who stretched the line on it? Or on what were its bases sunk? Who laid its cornerstone when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy?" It's an amazing picture of what Jesus himself was doing in those early times. "Have you ever commanded, ever in your life commanded the morning and caused the dawn to know its place, that it might take hold of the ends of the earth?" It's just a magnificent chapter. Job 38 gives us a glimpse of what Jesus was doing, as we know from John 1 and Colossians 1. This is the one that we're addressing as we pray. This is the one that we have joined our life with and whom we represent.

**Jesus's humility: taking true form as a bondservant**

Really seeing the majesty, authority, and status He had before the world was, He exists in His true form as God. So who is He? He is God, this majestic being who then empties Himself, verse seven. And that's taking the true form (morphe) as a bondservant of God. So the focus is always God. He's in the same form as God. He's a bondservant of God, focused on the Father, never Himself.

It's about one who is greater than He is, but He sets aside all of that authority, status, comfort, and majesty, all that he had out of love for God and for us, setting aside the privileges while still being completely God and completely human.

Many theologians have tried to pick all of this apart and debate different aspects of this. And the reminder is that the reason Paul mentioned this is so that we dwell together in unity and in humility instead of arguing over everything. The point is not arguing over fine points and writing PhD dissertations.

> It's just all the more amazing the contrast because He was all of that which you've just described, yet when He emptied Himself, He does not grasp for that which He actually is. When He came here and was being the servant, He wasn't grasping, trying to climb back up because He was accepting the role of the task He needed to do.
>
> That's just such a contrast to fallen humanity. We're just grasping and trying to climb ladders all the time, whereas He was not grasping for that which He was.

**True form: μορφή (morphe)**

> I have a question about the word that's translated form. 

We can use form in our translation, but with a footnote, because there is so much richness that depends on comprehending what these terms mean. They're terms used in ways that we don't normally understand.

Form seems like such an innocuous little word. We can use the idea of form to mean something superficial. But this is different. The Greek philosophers had a concept of the ideal and the real, where for everything real that had real existence on Earth, there was an ideal, which is an abstract that is not physical, and that the real is a representation of that ideal.

Though those terms are not used in this passage, this is what it's talking about: Jesus was truly God, always has been eternally truly God, and when He became a servant, He became truly a servant. This is not so much His undoing anything of what He was; He's revealing who He really is. God's nature is to serve, is to give life, is to love.

In a fallen world, that doesn't make sense because it's not natural in a fallen world. But in a perfect world, it would be natural and normal. Not insisting on equality with God: He didn't come in saying, "All right, guys, shape up. I'm God and you need to recognize that. So get with it." That was the problem with revealing the law: people didn't want anybody declaring himself superior.

So Jesus didn't declare Himself superior. He just demonstrated Himself to be superior, but in ways that they didn't expect. Instead of demanding that people bow down to Him... We all know that concept, starting all the way back during childhood. For example, in the Dr. Seuss book "The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins"—when the king passes by, you must bow down. And in Esther, Mordecai will not bow down to the king because they're human and he will bow down only to God.

Instead, He takes the true form of a bondservant. He's not pretending to be something that He isn't. He is demonstrating that He is, in fact, what we do not naturally desire to be. After the fall, we want to be served, not serve, which is backwards for God's purpose for us to be eager to serve.

**Example: the reality of new life in Christ expressed in a toddler**

It's been fun with our grandchildren to watch. They just turned four years old a couple of months ago. One of them, about six months since she asked Jesus into her heart, said after she did, "I thought about that for a long time before doing it." The reality was evident immediately.

Where it's showing up is her wanting to serve. She was in that stage where there's a lot of "tell me to do something, ask me to do something, and I will not because I don't kowtow to anybody." We all know: I'm godlike and born to rule. And all of a sudden, she's interested in serving, and she was preparing to help serve, to take care of the twins when they were born. And that's exactly what she's done. She's really demonstrating who she truly is now, as opposed to who she was as a natural fallen human being.

Now, we're not kidding ourselves into thinking that she suddenly has become the second incarnation of Christ, demonstrating what a perfect human being looks like and acts like. But this is the big surprise: that He who actually is God is eager to serve and demonstrating that in the form of a human being.

**Jesus communicated to us through His becoming one of us, a human**

A lot of translations say "being found in appearance as a human being." That's a literally correct translation. But the problem is that we readily misunderstand and think that what it's saying is, "Oh, He just appeared to be human." There have been massive theological debates over this. Was Jesus really a human being, or did He just use His divine power to look like a human being even though He wasn't?

This is talking about the mode of communication, the mode of revelation that He was found in appearance, meaning that we connected with Him, we interacted with Him by His expressing the reality of who He is through the medium of humanness. That's the point here. It's not that He just appeared to be a human being, but we were able to see and observe His making Himself apparent to us as a human being, as truly being a human being, that that's how we could see Him and grasp what we were seeing because it was familiar enough that we could get it.

> I just noticed that in verse 7, before it says, "being made in the likeness of man," and then verse 8, "being found in appearance as a man," before it says that, it says He "emptied Himself, taking the form of a bondservant." Before it says He's in the appearance of a man, which I think really, with what you're sharing, Steve, that's who He is. He's showing us what a bondservant is. He's the bondservant, and He's showing us who He's inhabiting. I don't even know how to say that, that He's a man, but it's really because He's God's bondservant. He's here as a servant.

If you remember back in the 70s: Jesus Christ Superstar. It was through listening to that and my answering questions that he asked that my younger brother became a believer. So God will use anything, but it had enough truth in it, even though there were some interesting fictional elements, it had enough truth in it that it raised questions. But Herod's taunt, "Walk across my swimming pool." And Jesus would not—he could perform miracles anytime. A miracle just being a work of power that demonstrated something beyond the normal. He could do it at any time. But he would not do it to show off and work in the temptations of the wilderness to prove who he was to the tempter, the liar who really didn't. He wasn't interested in finding out who Jesus was. He was interested in trying to break down the reality.

**The reality of Jesus' power and position, and how He used it**

I couldn't help as I was reading from Job 38 last night and then again tonight. "Have you commanded the dawn?" Oh, yeah, I have. It didn't obey. The night that seems to go on forever, and I wish it would be morning. We've all at times tried to make it be morning when we were tired of night because we weren't sleeping or whatever it was or because Santa Claus was supposed to have come through during the night and I want to open my stocking and see what's in there. But whatever it is, have you commanded the dawn and had it obey?

I love it, the disciples. "Who is this that even the wind and the waves obey him?" They were experienced fishermen on a lake that was notorious for sudden severe storms seeming to arise out of nowhere. I'm sure they tried to command the wind and the waves many times without success. Here Jesus just says a quiet word, and they do obey.

He has all this—the right to majesty of king of the universe—emptying himself, taking on, showing who he is as a bondservant, and giving up his status to become a Jewish baby bound for the cross. It really shows this amazing contrast. And as you said, Beth, the vertical motion from the highest to very low. And in 2 Corinthians 8:9, "For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich." And that's who he is.

And so there is this movement from the highest to the lowest, but actually even lower than that because now He humbles Himself, becoming obedient to God. His focus is always the Lord, the Father. It's not just "I'm being good, I'm doing good things". It's not on Himself; it's all on the Father. That's how He is able to do all that He does. "I've come to do the will of the one who sent me." "I always do what is pleasing to my Father," and that's the key for us. That's why the Lord through Paul is refocusing us on Him instead of on ourselves. Oh, I'm supposed to be humble, I'm supposed to be of one mind with this person. Our focus always goes to self, but He's saying no, have the focus on the one that I'm serving, and then I can serve with Him freely from the heart.

**Death by crucifixion**

And so He humbles Himself, becoming obedient to God as far as death, moreover death on a cross. We're now going even lower, not only becoming human, but death on a cross. And crucifixion was not simply a convenient mode of execution of prisoners. It was the way of ultimate indignity, a public statement by Rome that the crucified one was beyond contempt, not only excruciatingly and long physical pain, but that was magnified by degradation and humiliation. Part of their reason for it was to keep the population under control.

Crucifixion was public. They didn't take people off to some isolated place to crucify them. They set up the cross right on the sidewalk of the main roadways. People going from place to place would see crosses and would see people actually in the agony of dying on the cross. They left the bodies up there. They would see these deteriorating bodies of people who'd been crucified. It was a constant warning. You don't want to incur the ire of the Romans.

It actually was first, guess who came up with it? The Assyrians were the ones who began it, among some of the cruelest people on earth. When you were waiting to see the king of Assyria, the walls had famous tiles and frescoes of their favorite game of their soldiers, which was to skin people alive and see how long they could keep the people alive. They would have contests. Two or several teams of soldiers would go to work on some, each team on some victim, skinning the person alive with the objective of trying to make it last as long as possible before the person died. You won if yours was the last one left alive. They're the ones who originated crucifixion.

And they would also have torture devices on display as some of our students who have gone into closed countries have experienced. They've gone in undercover and in spite of all of their communications to people who are praying for them saying "do not show this to anyone, don't show my prayer letter to anybody", nonetheless they get called in to answer some questions. "You know why are you here", "what are you doing" and so forth. And they'd provide safe answers, and then out would come the sheet of paper, slapped on the desk, "and what's this?" Somebody had put the information out in a more public way. The room in which the interrogation took place was a room where all the walls were covered with a whole array of torture devices fastened up to the wall. So that's what you were looking at and being very aware of. Devices for causing pain that they never even imagined existed.

**The Lord's meekness: strength under control**

So that's how far Jesus goes in His obedience to the Father and out of love for us. I'm thinking of this hymn, the guy who wrote it must have had this passage in mind.  "Meekness and Majesty." The word meekness is not weakness; it is strength used in humble service, it's strength under control. The term was used to describe a tamed wild horse, where the goal was not to break the strength but to break the independence so that the strength could be used for good service. Interestingly, as much as a horse may fight the breaking process, the taming process, horses love to serve. Once they learn to cooperate with the master, they love showing off the teamwork.

Our girls were able to be part of some riding programs, which we were delighted with because we had both grown up with horses in two very different modes. But there was no way that we would be able to afford to have a horse as I did or lease or rent a horse or pay for a lot of riding stuff, as fortunately Erica was able to do growing up. But the Lord then provided a program and some people who wanted to fund the girls' participation because they saw it as a great opportunity for outreach for the gospel . I ended up scooping more horse poop than I ever dreamed of as part of it, but had many chances to come alongside others. Everybody, not just those sponsored like our girls, was expected to shovel. The horses were not cared for by the kids. "I'm not paying to shovel manure". And I'd be told, "oh, nobody's being paid. Nobody's paying to shovel manure. You're paying to participate in the program, and part of your payment is shoveling manure. So get with it. You don't shovel, you don't ride!"

The point is that they would come to the horse show at the end of the summer program. The day before the horse show, the horses got so excited, really excited. They could tell what was coming, and they were so eager to show off what they could do with these kids on their backs. It was amazing. The horses that were the most difficult to ride were the ones who were the most excited about the coming horse show.

Back to Jesus. This is the thing with being a servant and being voluntarily subject to mastery, because of the benefit to both the master and the servant, as for example, the horse and rider. As Steve has been pointing out, this is the ultimate counterpoint to the majesty of who He is as God, but it's actually demonstrating who He is as God. It also demonstrates what He's created us to be. We're created in the image of God. We are commissioned to rule the way God does, that is, to manage the affairs of life the way He does.

What does that mean? How do we go about it? Jesus said, "let me show you. I've described it to you, and that's difficult. But let me show you". It's like the practical demonstration in the science class during the lecture, and then replicating it for yourself in the lab. It's not the, "let me show you what I have in mind, said the professor as he erased the blackboard".

**Partnership in the Trinity**

The beauty, again, talking about the partnership, the incarnation, and Jesus doing the will of the Father, executing God's will as a human being and doing what pleases Him. His Heavenly Father, doing what pleases God. This was deeply satisfying to both God the Father and God the Son. This was special that they got to do this because that cooperation is what the relationship within the Godhead is all about. The Son is voluntarily subject to the Father, and that delights both the Spirit and is subject to the Son, and that delights all three. That's what He's showing here. It's not what you would think. Let me show you what it's really like.

Now we get to verse nine. Therefore, and of course, as you know, when you hit therefore, you always ask what it's there for. It's because Jesus humbled Himself on the cross out of love for the Lord, for God the Father, and for us, He demonstrated that He truly shared the divine nature of God, who is love. 1 John 4:8, "God is love." Jesus demonstrated that to the ultimate degree, that He shared that divine nature and was showing forth who the Father is and who God is in that movement, vertical movement from the highest to the lowest and going all the way to the cross to open the way for us. It's the ultimate demonstration of who God is in the divine love.

And therefore, God raises him exceedingly and gives him freely the name above every name, that in the name of Jesus, every knee may bow of those in heaven, those on earth, those under the earth, and every tongue confess, and we'll go on to Jesus Christ as Lord, the glory of God the Father. Because Jesus has demonstrated to the ultimate how far the Lord's love goes, he is exalted higher than he was before. He was God. How much higher can you get? But he is, because he has demonstrated in practice who the Lord is and how far His love goes for us. He is God, raises him exceedingly, and gives him freely the name above every name, that at his name every knee may bow.

In heaven, on earth, those under the earth, every tongue confess. He's now demonstrated this love, and he's even higher. It's kind of a reflection of what the Lord does with us, Romans 5. The last half talks about that when we come to the Lord, we don't just get back to the garden. It's not just back to the original. We now are much more, and that's the key term that shows up again and again through that second half of Romans 5, that we're much more. We now reign over our inner lives to start with and the things that we have stewardship over and with the Lord. Here Jesus is raised up exceedingly and really proclaimed King of Kings and Lord of Lords because he's demonstrated the love to the ultimate of who God is.

"At the name of Jesus, every knee may bow." That terminology gets used of God in Isaiah 45:23, "God is the one to whom every knee bows in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and every tongue confesses." Jesus actually picks this up in Matthew 28:18. "All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations."

He's now, having gone through this whole paradigm of demonstrating the Lord's love, given all authority in a new way, in a fresh way. Verse 11, "Every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father." The first name that he's known by is still his human name, Jesus, which means God saves, because he is the member of the Godhead who has demonstrated this love to the extent of this love in human form. But it's tied then with Christ, which is Messiah, the anointed one who was promised who would come to save, and he is Lord. He's over all, but it goes even higher because he doesn't keep it to himself. It's to the glory of God the Father.

As we've talked about before, nothing that the Lord does is for Himself. It's always to bless others. The Son is given all authority in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, everywhere. He gives it to the Father, as shown in 1 Corinthians 15:28. We know that after He's been given all authority and shows up in all His fullness of who he is, He doesn't keep the glory to Himself, but the Son gives the glory to the Father.

> "And when all things are subjected to Him, then the Son Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all."

It's not something that's done to Him. It's something that we know He joyfully gives. It's always been under the Father. Even when all authority is now His in practice, He doesn't keep it for Himself, but it's for the Father.

**Every knee will bow**

> Question: Is "under the earth" in this context like animals in the sea, or is it speaking of the dead, the underworld? 

I think it's those who are in the grave because every knee may bow. The focus is on human beings throughout.

We know from Revelation that the dead are raised, and everyone comes to the judgment seat of Christ. This may even imply, if there's a contrast between those in heaven and those under the earth—those who have died and who have risen to new life in Christ, and those under the earth being those who have died and are not raised because they never accepted the offer of new life, but they nonetheless have to bow to Jesus' authority.

Those in heaven and believers on earth bow to Jesus' authority with great joy. Those who have rejected the gift have to bow, but they do so very unwillingly and resentfully. I think the sense in which they have to bow is they have to acknowledge Jesus' sovereignty. As hard as they fought against God, they did not win, and they bitterly resent the fact that God won because they didn't want Him to. That's my take.

The outer darkness is full of weeping and gnashing of teeth. Erica's sense is that the weeping is self-pity and the gnashing of teeth is anger. Jesus talks about where the fire is not quenched. There's burning self-pity and there's burning anger, and both are seething. There is no out for a fallen human being who is not going to welcome the torment of defeat. It goes on forever because it can't be resolved. The only way it can be resolved is in acknowledging the need for forgiveness and welcoming it.

We had a former student who was doing work in a closed country, and actually a colleague there declared openly, "I am god," and nobody could get along with him. He was the most caustic, difficult person because everything had to be his way. He started coming toward the Lord and changing, and the Lord willing, he's come all the way. They had to leave that country because things really shut down, but he was well on the way when they left. The Lord completes what He begins, and there was humility coming. He discovered he was not God. But we all need to find out.

We studied Ephesians last year. Ephesians 1, the end of the first chapter, brings up this same sort of thing. Starting in verse 19, "the surpassing greatness of His power toward us," which He brought about in Christ when He raised Him from the dead. As far down as you can go, having carried all of our sin on Himself and seated Him at the right hand in the heavenlies, "far above all rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in the one to come." He's put all things in subjection under His feet and gave Him as head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all. He's over everything, including spiritual powers, as well as earthly powers, and that's who we serve. We're His body. We get to demonstrate this sort of love where we live and have the joy of doing it in concert with our Lord, who's our forerunner and who enables it.

The encouragement is to spend time focusing here in praise and worship and looking at other passages that talk about each of these aspects so that we have much more fully in mind who we pray to, in whose steps we walk, in whose fellowship we walk, and the power of what we get to demonstrate.

**Interpretation: "the name which is above every name"**

I don't want to undercut the sublime focus, but I would like to take advantage of an opportunity for an exercise in sharpening our interpretive skills.

As Erica was reading various commentaries on this, she came across a note by one commentator regarding verse 9, where God raises Him exceedingly and gives Him the name above every name. The commentator said nobody knows what that name is. How do you feel about that statement? From your consideration of the text itself, how do you evaluate that statement and what do you conclude?

The next verse says, "so that at the name of Jesus." Isn't that the name? Bingo. Right on target. In verse 11, "Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God." Exactly. The lesson here is context, context, context. If something is puzzling, it either has already been explained, but because we didn't anticipate where the text was going to go, we didn't grasp the significance of it, and so it slid past us, or it is just about to be explained. One or the other. I think the commentator got so tunneled in on verse 9 that he didn't consider it.

Now, here's also an issue: considering possible alternative meanings of a particular set of words, particular phrasing, the semantics, the words used, the syntax, the way the words are used in combination together, gives Him the name. I think the commentator interpreted that to mean that He gave Jesus a new name that He didn't have before. That's a legitimate possibility given the words, but that's not the only possibility. The range of meanings. He gives him a new name. Maybe the characteristics of the name not being a new mnemonic label, a new semantic label, but a name of a different significance. It doesn't say new name. It just says gives him freely the name that's above every name. That alternative is to say that the name, which He's already had, is elevated to a status above every other name. At the name of Jesus, the name that we already knew He was given on God's instructions through the angel to Mary at birth, He was to be named Jesus, which means God saves.

Basically, it's like Joshua is Yeshua. Joshua is a non-Jewish form of the term Yeshua, which is translated Jesus. You've probably known some Hispanics who are named Jesus. People growing up with Jesus, you know the carpenter's kid, is about as much as using the name Jesus would convey to them. It was a common name. It was a common name because it was brought with such wonderful meaning. So you name your kid, God saves.

You get the extremes of this in a places like Ghana, where the beauty parlor is the Gates of Heaven Beauty Parlor. And then you go down the street to the Garden of Eden Grocery Store. Everything is named like that. I was talking with a student from Nigeria who said it's very similar in her part of Nigeria. I was intrigued by a neighbor of ours's name, which I found in the student directory. Beautiful name. I wrote it out because it was just so beautiful. A graduate student or a graduate student's wife saw it written in my study and she said, "that's my language!" She was stunned. How did I have this phrase in her language written? And she said, it means "love of Jesus sweeter than honey." Later, I saw the neighbor and I told her "I saw your full name written down it is so beautiful" and she was delighted and I said "especially the meaning" and she was resentful. So obviously her parents had stuck that on her and she did not like it.

Anyway, the name of Jesus, as the kid was growing up in the little town it was just like "Josh, the carpenter's kid". But then we now know what it has become in status.

Well let's pray. 

> Lord, thank you. We stand in awe of you and the amazing lengths you have gone to demonstrate the love that you have as God for us, going from the highest to the very lowest, to what none of us would ever, ever choose, but you willingly chose it for us. Thank you for the lengths to which your love will go in humility and in service to the Father and out of love for us. And Lord, you are exalted far, far beyond all rule and authority in every name that's named. And Lord, we praise you. We thank you. We stand in awe and wonder that you would love us and go to such lengths to make us yours. Lord, may we join you in demonstrating your radical love to those around us. May we have joy in that with you. In your name, amen.

Amen.
