              <h3>Stanford: a training ground for Biblical counselors.</h3>
              <hr />
              <p>The setting for the Parakaleo ministry is the Stanford University community, where staff members have counseled and trained Biblical counselors since 1975.</p>
              <p>The Stanford campus can be an atmosphere of intense pressure not only for undergraduate and graduate students, but also for faculty and staff. Personal needs encountered by Parakaleo counselors include uncertainties about sexuality, marriage, family strife, academic adequacy, careers, self-worth, depression and suicide.</p>
              <p>The needs are too great for one or two counselors to meet. Thus Parakaleo staff members place high priority on discipling counselors among students in addition to counseling students themselves. Central to the training program is the Biblical counseling course at Stanford.</p>
              <p>Because Stanford University attracts students with leadership abilities, Parakaleo counselors are in an unusually strategic position to help develop Christian leaders.</p>
              <p>Over a thousand students have been trained and counseled by Parakaleo during its first three decades of ministry. At least 75 of these have entered vocational Christian ministries, while numerous others have applied their training as church elders.</p>
              <p>Several hundred have gone on short-term missions in Eastern and Western Europe, India, Asia, Africa and Latin America. Others have obtained counseling positions in secular environments or entered professions with significant opportunities for counseling, such as medicine and law.</p>
              <p>These leaders minister as they have been equipped and also disciple more counselors. Once they move on, Parakaleo remains available to serve these counselor by correspondence, publications, cassette tapes, and other training materials, as requested.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="parakaleo-name" class="tab-pane fade in">
              <h3>Why "Parakaleo"?</h3>
              <hr />
              <blockquote>“Blessed be the ... God of all counsel; who counsels
                us in all our affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who
                are in any affliction...”
                <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+1%3A3-4&amp;version=NASB" target="_blank">2 Corinthians 1:3-4</a></blockquote>
              <p>"Parakaleo" means "to call alongside". A Greek word in the
                original Biblical manuscripts, it can be translated as "counsel", and
                also as "comfort, console, encourage, urge, appeal, exhort" — all of
                which describe aspects of the counseling process.</p>
              <p>"Parakaleo" appears in the Bible on a list of distinct "gifts of
                the Spirit". Counseling, as all ministry, is done to a certain extent
                by all believers, but some are specially equipped to use this gift as
                their primary ministry in the body of Christ. Our ministry focuses on
                these people, training them to serve in Christian counseling,
                applying scripture actively and practically to the lives of
                believers. These principles are equally valuable in ministering to
                unbelievers in evangelic counseling.</p>
              <p></p>"Parakaleo" is also the term Jesus chose to designate the Holy
              Spirit in His coming to live in and minister through every Christian — under the Lordship of Christ, using His words. Hence, the
              Parakaleo ministry is also concerned with equipping Christians in
              general to apply God's Word accurately in their lives and in
              ministering to others.

              <h3>Biblical truth equips counselors effectively.</h3>
              <hr />
              <blockquote>“...equipping the saints for the work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+4%3A12&amp;version=NASB" target="_blank">Ephesians 4:12</a></blockquote>
              <p>We believe counseling is central in the process of Christian growth and the use of the Bible is central in Christian counseling.<br /></p>
              <p style="&#10;    margin-bottom: 5px;&#10;"><strong>Our purpose is to equip Christians:</strong></p>
              <ul class="typography">
                <li>to regard the Bible as the supreme authority and resource for counseling.<br /></li>
                <li>to use Bible exposition as the chief method for counseling and encouragement, turning to specific sections in the pages of Scripture, explaining their meaning, and letting them speak directly and personally to the counselee, according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.<br /></li>
                <li>to handle the Word of Truth accurately.<br /></li>
                <li>to provide effective counseling primarily in personal or pastoral rather than detached settings.<br /></li>
                <li>to depend on the Holy Spirit, not self-effort, to guide and empower Biblical counseling through diligent prayer.<br /></li>
              </ul>
              <div><br /></div>
              <h3>God's Word answers personal problems.</h3>
              <hr />
              <blockquote>“All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.” <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%203:16-17&amp;version=NASB" target="_blank">2 Timothy 3:16-17</a></blockquote>
              <p>There is no problem in life that God does not address adequately in His Word.<br /></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, many people have difficulty finding answers in the Bible to their own problems — or to the problems of those they are counseling. What makes it so hard for Christians to see how the Gospel applies practically to the problems of daily life?<br /></p>
              <p style="&#10;    margin-bottom: 5px;&#10;">Biblical revelation is not inadequate; what is inadequate is our understanding of what the Bible says.</p>
              <ul class="typography">
                <li>The Bible says God meets personal needs through the redeeming work of His Spirit — here and now. God's perfect wisdom for solving personal problems and the practical means of appropriating God's resources are revealed in key passages throughout the Bible.<br /></li>
                <li>It also says God works through believers to counsel and encourage others, relying on His Word and the power of the Holy Spirit.</li>

              <div class="testimony">
                <p>Fortunately, God has given us His Word as a manual for living. For 40 years, Steve and Erica Lawry have been teaching wisdom from God's Word and showing its applicability to everyday life at the Biblical Counseling Course. When I attended
                  the course last winter, a classmate asked me, "So, at this class, are you being counseled, or are you learning how to counsel?" I replied that the answer was "Both!" As we learn to counsel others from Scripture, we necessarily find that
                  the Bible not only provides the most effective counsel for the world's problems, but also our own as well.</p>

              <div class="testimony">
                <p>Friends-</p>
                <p>I can't say enough good things about the personal and spiritual benefits of this class! It is for practical folks who are interested in learning more about God's word from a new perspective, for those looking for Biblical tools to help 'counsel'
                  others, and for those who wonder how God's word can apply to their every-day life.</p>
                <p>If you're not sure you want to commit, no worries. Just set aside a bit of time next [Wednesday] (now offered on <span class="course-weekday">Monday</span>) evening and go check it out. There is no pressure to sign up -- you won't be disappointed!!</p>

              <div class="testimony">
                <p>This is not your ordinary Bible study. More than any other Bible study I have attended, this course explains how the Bible so powerfully applies to every aspect of our daily (and often messy) lives. When I attended the course during the
                  past winter and spring quarters, I was often taken aback about what the Bible had to say about certain issues---it was so incredibly profound, so beyond what I would expect from even the wisest people, that at once I became convicted at
                  the heart that the Bible is truly God's Word to man.</p>
                <p>Both Steve and Erica have special gifts to help bring these profound insights in the Bible to light. Steve is one of the most careful expositors of the Scriptures that I know, and Erica has her own sweet way of sharing how these Scriptures
                  apply to our down-to-earth lives. The examples given are often taken from their own experiences and struggles, and they are very specific and practical. What I especially enjoyed was how both shared funny situations (at least in hindsight!)
                  that all of us deal with, but somehow are seldom communicated with clarity in a large group setting.</p>

              <div class="testimony">
                <p>As Christians at Stanford, we have an amazing opportunity to influence those around us through our faith, yet often we may feel unequipped for this task. The Biblical Counseling Course at Stanford is a great place to be outfitted as an effective
                  Christian, to learn how the Bible can empower us to face difficult counseling issues in our lives and the lives of our friends, families, and acquaintances.</p>
                <p>Taught by Steve and Erica Lawry, the Biblical Counseling Course is a year-long, once-a-week course that aims to make the Bible a useful manual for living for Christians. Steve and Erica—both Stanford graduates—have taught this
                  course for over 30 years, giving them unique wisdom and perspective on the Stanford community. Using both examples of their own counseling experiences and insights from their personal studies in the course, the Lawrys' study of the Word
                  is both infectious and exciting. Autumn quarter is devoted to individual counseling issues, Winter quarter examines counseling interpersonal relationships, and Spring quarter explores counseling issues explicitly related to male-female
                  relationships. Start at any time, but beware, you will soon be hooked!</p>
                <p>The heart of the course is the story of God's redemptive nature, worked out in our salvation and evident in our relationships. Beginning in Genesis with a look at fallen human tendencies and traits, the course moves into an in-depth look
                  at the power of God's redemptive love in freeing us from our fallen nature, and from there discusses how our new lives in Christ can be lived out relationally with those around us. The Biblical Counseling Course really does make the Bible
                  a manual for living, equipping students with the knowledge of key passages and themes for living application, and gives the confidence to approach difficult issues from a scriptural standpoint.</p>
                <p>For me, the Biblical Counseling Course has been a wonderful blessing in my life, restoring to me a deep appreciation of the Bible's power as an amazing resource for living. All too often, God's Word is unfortunately transformed into a mere
                  academic text or an aloof religious treatise. The course restores the Bible to its full power, showing both the amazing intricacy of God's Word as well as its accessibility and applicability in our own lives. The Bible took on new meaning
                  for me, as it helped me to understand how to approach difficult problems Biblically, such as overcoming bad habits, a flagging prayer life, and day-to-day relationships with roommates, family and friends. Additionally, the Course delves
                  into a fascinating study of nature of human beings and our God-inspired image and how the sinful corruption of our relationship with God and the world is at the heart of the most challenging counseling issues we face, as well as how the
                  redeemed relationship of the believer with God enables us to walk in victorious new life. In my opinion, the Biblical Counseling Course is a must-take for every Christian at Stanford-an experience that will confirm your faith, challenge
                  your lifestyle, impact those in your life, and restore to you a hunger for knowing Him.</p>

                <p>To me, the best thing about the class is that the teaching comes from the Bible, and the Lawrys illustrate how these truths can and should be successfully applied to many of the common issues we and our friends face daily. Personally, I
                  think the title could be somewhat misleading, as we typically associate counseling with human efforts to find our "true inner being" or something fuzzy like that, or to help people put on band-aids so they become more optimistic about
                  situations.</p>
                <p>Rather, I would describe it as Bible exposition from key scriptures that help us understand how the Lord has fashioned us and how we are to relate to Him and to others. The material in the class has helped me appreciate the beauty of God's
                  design and the magnificence of the Word. Thus, it is not just useful for addressing problems and issues; it helps us live with greater fulness and appreciation. I have found myself sharing these truths with seekers, as well, because there
                  is so much that any person can relate to. For many, it's a surprise that the Bible speaks clearly on situations we think are peculiar to our day or our own lives.</p>

                <p>Parakaleo is a deeply biblical and practical ministry, and it has been foundational in my walk with the Lord and in preparing me to serve others. Steve and Erica teach with so much, love, gratitude, wisdom, and knowledge. Through this ministry,
                  I have learned that to have a deep reliance on Scripture, and I have learned to have so much hope in God growing others and me through His Holy Spirit inside of me. It is so special that students have the opportunity to learn and fellowship
                  in this ministry.</p>

              <p>Parakaleo Christian Ministries was established by Steve Lawry in 1975. Earlier he had attended Stanford University as both an undergraduate and graduate student. He began by training counselors in a campus group under the supervision and training of two local pastors.</p>
              <p>Steve married Erica, also a Stanford graduate, in 1976. Together they embarked on a ministry of counseling and training counselors. Now continuing to grow in the Lord as parents also, this husband-wife team continues to serve as the nucleus of the Parakaleo staff. From time to time interns join the ministry.</p>

              <p>The ministry has expanded as students trained by Parakaleo are serving the Lord in many parts of the world. Parakaleo staff has conducted training seminars in Biblical counseling to missionary staff teams in the field, including Eastern and Western Europe.</p>
              <p>The ministry's spiritual and financial support continues to depend on the prayers and faithfulness of many people. It has been a great encouragement over the decades that most of the support for the ministry comes from former students, often years after they have taken the <a class="obvious" href="http://parakaleo.stanford.edu">Biblical Counseling Course</a>.</p>

              <p>In this time of extended sheltering-in when we can’t visit friends, gather in churches and in fellowship groups, go to the gym, etc.</p>
              <ul class="typography">
                <li>the longing for relationships is far greater</li>
                <li>and the need to learn the skills for building real relationships is greater as well<br /></li>
                <li>as we are sheltered in with family or friends, day after day in the limited space of apartments &amp; homes!</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This fall we will be studying Ephesians, God’s wisdom for partnering deeply with the Lord to build life-giving, God-filled relationships with people who are just as much in process as we are!!</p>
              <p>This study will be very helpful for relating to the very difficult and the delightful people in our lives (we can all be both!!).  It will be helpful for singles, dating couples and marrieds.  All undergraduate and grad students are welcome! (and their relationship partners, if any, of course).</p>

            most careful expositors of the Scriptures that I know, and Erica
            has her own sweet way of sharing how these Scriptures apply to our
            down-to-earth lives. The examples given are often taken from their
            own experiences and struggles, and they are very specific and
            practical. What I especially enjoyed was how both shared funny
            situations (at least in hindsight!) that all of us deal with, but
            somehow are seldom communicated with clarity in a large group
            setting.”

          <h3>Why "Parakaleo"?</h3>
          <hr />
          <p>"Parakaleo" means "to call alongside". A Greek word in the
            original Biblical manuscripts, it can be translated as "counsel", and
            also as "comfort, console, encourage, urge, appeal, exhort" — all of
            which describe aspects of the counseling process.</p>
          <p>"Parakaleo" appears in the Bible on a list of distinct "gifts of
            the Spirit". Counseling, as all ministry, is done to a certain extent
            by all believers, but some are specially equipped to use this gift as
            their primary ministry in the body of Christ. Our ministry focuses on
            these people, training them to serve in Christian counseling,
            applying scripture actively and practically to the lives of
            believers. These principles are equally valuable in ministering to
            unbelievers in evangelic counseling.</p>
          <p></p>"Parakaleo" is also the term Jesus chose to designate the Holy
          Spirit in His coming to live in and minister through every Christian
          -- under the Lordship of Christ, using His words. Hence, the
          Parakaleo ministry is also concerned with equipping Christians in
          general to apply God's Word accurately in their lives and in
          ministering to others.<p></p>
